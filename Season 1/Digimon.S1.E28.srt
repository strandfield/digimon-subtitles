1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,355
Genai really threw us for a
loop when he told us there

2
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:06,420
was an eighth child and
it was up to us to find him.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,940
We were just about to pass through the
gate that would take us into the human

4
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:14,740
world when we were rudely interrupted by a
trouble-making Digimon called Gatomon.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,800
Talk about your bad luck!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,960
The door closed right in our faces!

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,905
Now that pestering feline
is off to find the missing

8
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,480
child and we're stuck here,
not knowing what to do.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,920
Somehow we have to find a way to open that
gate, but how?

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,920
Digimon!

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Digital Monsters!

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,500
Digimon are the champions!

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,980
Digimon!

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Digital Monsters!

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,500
Digimon are the champions!

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,580
Change into Digital Champions to save the
digital world!

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,900
Digimon!

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
Digital Monsters!

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,460
Digimon are the champions!

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,900
Digimon!

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,120
Digital Monsters!

22
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,460
Digimon are the champions!

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,620
Digimon, N2 champions!

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,520
Are the champions!

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,960
Digimon!

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,220
Digital monsters!

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,520
Digimon are the champions!

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Digimon!

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,240
Iota's man has shut the gate.

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,400
You can't follow him now.

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,856
Listen, Pops, you've got to help us get
through that gate.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,480
The eighth kid is doomed if we don't.

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,620
And that isn't all.

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,176
If that rotten creep
goes on a rampage in the

35
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:41,540
real world, lots of innocent
people will get hurt.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,920
There just has to be some way we can open
the gate up again!

37
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,460
Well, of course there is.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,320
No kidding?

39
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,660
How then?

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,220
Any door can be opened with the right
keys.

41
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,980
Oh, don't be so mysterious, Jedi!

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,020
Follow me to my house and I will explain
everything.

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Where's that?

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,780
Look above you!

45
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,080
What kind of directions are those?

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,980
Very good ones if you will just listen.

47
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,620
Huh?

48
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Huh?

49
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,560
Keep looking and you shall see it.

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,080
There!

51
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
A searchlight!

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,440
Sorry I ran out of maps.

53
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,660
Follow the light and you can't miss it.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Excellent!

55
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,280
Snack time for me.

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Let's jet!

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,840
Looks like we're gonna be doing a little
swimming.

58
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,580
My hat!

59
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
My beautiful hat!

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,320
Either we got those directions really wrong
or Jedi's house is in the middle of a lake.

61
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,420
So that's why I've never found it.

62
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Must be really tough to get pizza
delivered.

63
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,741
Hmm?

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
Hey, come on in!

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
The water's fine!

66
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
Oh no!

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Huh?

68
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:54,850
Steps?

69
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,650
All right gang, we're in business!

70
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,170
There are stairs going right down into the
lake.

71
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,130
They must lead to Jedi's house.

72
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,330
Well, what are we waiting for?

73
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,890
I was kinda hoping we'd send a boat to
make us up.

74
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,610
Hey!

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,600
If anyone wants any sushi, now's your
chance!

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,280
I wish I had my boats!

77
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Me too!

78
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,820
Quite a place, if you don't mind living in
Pink Bob.

79
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
No long, Domo.

80
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,780
I don't see a doorbell.

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Hey, Mr. Jedi!

82
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,900
We're here!

83
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,160
Hey!

84
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Who needs a doorbell with such noisy
visitors?

85
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,280
Huh?

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
It's the real Jedi!

87
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
Who did you expect?

88
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,900
Santa Claus?

89
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,500
We've just never seen the real you!

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:37,980
Yeah!

91
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,040
So tell us!

92
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,460
How come you're always hiding?

93
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm not!

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,760
Well, you could've come in person,
but you always choose projections, right?

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,420
It's just a show to impress you.

96
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,000
What kind of a person are you,
anyway?

97
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,720
A human?

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,380
Or some kind of Digimon?

99
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,220
That is not important.

100
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,500
How come you call us the Digi-destined?

101
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,380
Easy, I'm old, but I'm not deaf.

102
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,980
You were chosen to save this world and
your own.

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,760
But just how were we chosen?

104
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,480
Why us?

105
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,520
Yeah, we only signed up for summer camp.

106
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,680
That is all you need to know for now.

107
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Come inside.

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,980
The most important thing is to return to
your world and find the eighth child.

109
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,080
That, and maybe have a nice bowl of soup
with a tuna sandwich.

110
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,740
Look at the fish!

111
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,200
But those are halibut.

112
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,500
They're saltwater fish.

113
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
You are right.

114
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,040
So I have to feed them popcorn and salty
pretzels and tons of salted nuts.

115
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,576
Do you think he's pulling our legs?

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I have no idea.

117
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,520
Now a look at the weather.

118
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,720
State, county, city.

119
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,920
Does anyone recognize this area?

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Our hometown?

121
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,060
Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,520
And the red flashing circle indicates.

123
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,580
Myotismon's location.

124
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,620
Myotismon!

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,140
Wow, he's only a mile from where we all
live.

126
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,580
I'm afraid so.

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,900
I'll bet you that he goes downtown.

128
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,760
This is not good.

129
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
What'd you find?

130
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,500
Nothing.

131
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,540
The table's fine.

132
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,440
So what's causing all this interference?

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,940
Please tell us how to open the gate back
to our world.

134
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,920
You certainly are impatient.

135
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
Keep your goggles on, my young friend.

136
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
You'll need these.

137
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Check them out!

138
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,140
Whoa!

139
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,600
Digimon key cards.

140
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,060
It's the spinning image.

141
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,780
All right, look at Gomamon.

142
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
I'm cuter in person.

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,540
There I am, too!

144
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,880
But what are they for?

145
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,360
Yeah, and how do they help us open the
gate?

146
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Well, there are nine holes on the stone
wall of the gate.

147
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,220
Yeah, so... Oh, wait!

148
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,020
Do the cards go into the holes?

149
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:44,021
That's right.

150
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,360
However, take a closer look.

151
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,800
It's not quite as simple as that.

152
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
Do you see the problem?

153
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,600
You're giving us one too many cards.

154
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
That's right.

155
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,320
One of them is a fake.

156
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,140
Oh!

157
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,720
We'll try them all.

158
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,300
Till we get the right combination.

159
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,840
No, you will not, you silly boy.

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,860
That's absolutely the last thing you
should do.

161
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,580
There are many, many other worlds.

162
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,800
If you put the cards in the wrong holes,
it'll be a disaster.

163
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,800
You could end up in a different world with
no way to return.

164
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Let me explain.

165
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,385
The wrong cards might
take you to a world where,

166
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:21,081
for example, people
in Digimon switch skins.

167
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,920
No!

168
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Not that!

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,040
I like my skin!

170
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,400
Don't worry, don't worry!

171
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,461
You're not going to switch
your skin with anyone as

172
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:30,821
long as you learn how
to use the cards correctly.

173
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,140
But we don't have any idea what to do.

174
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,420
You must learn to use your power the way
Myotismon is using his.

175
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,960
Tomorrow I'll teach you the proper use of
the cards.

176
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,860
The digital world is like our world,
but different.

177
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Why is that?

178
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,580
The same material is used in all worlds.

179
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Molecules and atoms?

180
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,320
Exactly!

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,500
Everything here in the digital world,
plants, trees, buildings, even the Digimon

182
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,080
themselves came from computer data in your
world.

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,160
So if there are strange things here, they
are the result of broken or missing data.

184
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:06,620
What about you, Geni?

185
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,860
Are you just made up of computer data,
too?

186
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,800
Of course!

187
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,100
So in each of the worlds, I would appear
somewhat different.

188
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,460
But Geni, if you're not human,
how are you different from Digimon?

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,900
I have no attributes.

190
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,180
Attributes?

191
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,540
Just what does that mean?

192
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,360
You mean the different attacks Digimon
have?

193
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,120
Yes!

194
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,280
And the way a Digimon digivolves.

195
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,740
But attributes determine much more than
that.

196
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,720
They explain why some Digimon are good and
some are evil.

197
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:35,060
All Digimon can be classified as data,
virus or vaccine.

198
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,240
We're definitely familiar with the virus
kind.

199
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,160
By the way, have you used that Digimon
analyzer I gave you?

200
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,400
Yes, but there is something I wanted to
ask you about it.

201
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
What's that?

202
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,420
I'm only able to access information on
Digimon that I have seen.

203
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,760
Not on the ones that the other kids have
seen.

204
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,220
Hmm, you're right.

205
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
That is a problem.

206
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,960
Is it one that you can solve?

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,040
You just leave it to me, my young friend.

208
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,680
I should have it all taken care of by
morning.

209
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,700
But for now, you had better get some rest.

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Okay.

211
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,660
Wow, Joe.

212
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,120
Why not just eat the bones, too?

213
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,380
Hey, I was hungry.

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Huh?

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,240
Good morning, all.

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,960
Hi.

217
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,640
Izzy, I completed the modifications for
your computer.

218
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,060
When you insert someone's Digivice into
this adapter, the analyzer will show

219
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:24,860
information on any Digimon that person has
seen.

220
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,860
I also installed a new screensaver.

221
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,400
You know, the one with the colored fishes
swimming around?

222
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,620
I really like that one.

223
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,100
Great minds do think alike.

224
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,180
And now I have a request for all of you.

225
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,720
I don't want you to forget that you are
the Digi-destined.

226
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,620
I'll never forget this stomachache.

227
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,240
Joe, this is serious.

228
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,840
I have done all I can do.

229
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,320
I can no longer help you once you return
to my Otismon's castle.

230
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Good luck.

231
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,800
Man, this place looks even scarier than it
did the first time.

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,980
How do we get past the DaVidramon?

233
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,240
Leave that to me.

234
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll take him out while you go in.

235
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Mm-hmm.

236
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Digimon!

237
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,960
Digimon!

238
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,620
Digimon!

239
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Digimon!

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Digimon!

241
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Digimon!

242
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,470
Digimon!

243
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,890
Digimon!

244
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,410
Mega Kabuterimon!

245
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,530
Let's go!

246
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Now's our chance!

247
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,770
Hornbuster!

248
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,010
Oh, so much for a quiet entrance.

249
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,730
Hornbuster!

250
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,590
What happened, Issa?

251
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,950
Everything's turned all right side up
again.

252
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,650
You fix the warp in space.

253
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,170
Come on, let's get to the gate!

254
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,110
We've got to figure out the pattern in
these cards.

255
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,210
Hmm.

256
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:11,650
What?

257
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,830
A clue?

258
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,930
Good one?

259
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,190
Bad one?

260
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,530
Funky one?

261
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,750
Maybe... In-training,
rookie, and champion?

262
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,190
Or could it just be small one,
medium one, big one?

263
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,350
How can we be sure?

264
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,010
And we still don't have a clue which card
has the fake one.

265
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,910
Maybe it's where they live.

266
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,210
Water or land?

267
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,190
Maybe the key is in their names.

268
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,110
Like, Agamon starts with A.

269
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,210
That's letter number one.

270
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,750
Then... Oh, no.

271
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,510
It really doesn't make any sense.

272
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,830
Izzy, what are you looking at?

273
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,490
My Otismon used a spell to open the gate.

274
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,930
And I think this picture must have
something to do with it.

275
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,270
Some of these characters I know.

276
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,990
Sagittarius and Leo are signs of the
zodiac.

277
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,410
But there's nothing about a monkey in any
horoscope.

278
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,530
And what's the significance of this star
pattern?

279
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,170
What's that spell?

280
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,250
I don't know.

281
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,330
Well, maybe somebody should go take us.

282
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,331
I'll go find out.

283
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,890
Come on, guys.

284
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,370
We have to figure out the cards.

285
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:07,670
Yeah.

286
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,490
Let's go.

287
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,530
What's the point?

288
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,770
We'll never unlock the gate.

289
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,330
Don't even say that, Joe.

290
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,453
Even if we put the cards
in the holes so they look

291
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:17,610
right, we have no way of
knowing until it's too late.

292
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,030
We have to try, Joe.

293
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,610
Something tells me we don't have much
time.

294
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:25,611
Hey, everyone.

295
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,810
The walls and ceilings in the castle are
caving in.

296
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,150
The passages are all blocked.

297
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,230
That means we can't go back the way we
came in.

298
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,110
We're trapped.

299
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,770
Now we have to open the gate.

300
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,630
One of us has to choose nine cards and put
them in the holes, and that'll be that.

301
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,710
You, Ty.

302
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,370
Me?

303
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,570
Yeah, it's your call.

304
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,530
Mine?

305
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,690
Why is it up to me?

306
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,270
I'm not trying to put you on the spot or
anything like that.

307
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,330
I just think we all really believe in you.

308
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:47,830
Ty?

309
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,670
Me?

310
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,890
Joe's right.

311
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,090
In times like these, decisions need to be
made by the one in charge.

312
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:53,510
Hold on.

313
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,950
Have you guys all gone crazy?

314
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,010
Who made me a leader?

315
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,610
Do you remember when you were gone,
Ty?

316
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,410
We fell apart without you around.

317
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,179
And after all that,
weren't you the one who

318
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,970
managed to bring us
all back together again?

319
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,250
Uh, yeah, I guess.

320
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:04,970
Just do it, Ty!

321
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,510
Uh-huh.

322
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,130
Mimi?

323
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,050
I just want to get back to my home,
that's all!

324
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,450
Oh!

325
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,350
I'm sorry.

326
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,650
I was being selfish again.

327
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,150
I have to remember we're a team.

328
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:15,970
Come on, Ty.

329
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,690
Save the day!

330
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,010
Yeah, we have to believe in our friends.

331
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,430
Remember what Jenai said?

332
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,550
Yeah, he said to believe in our power.

333
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,050
You believe, don't you, Ty?

334
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:24,910
Maybe.

335
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,850
Come on.

336
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,870
We've gone through a lot of weird stuff
already.

337
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,730
If we hadn't stuck together, we never
would have beaten Sidramon.

338
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,030
Or smashed Tyrannomon.

339
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,470
Or escaped from Toy Town.

340
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,230
And I'd still be making french fries in
Vegemon's diner if you hadn't saved me.

341
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,530
You can do it, Ty.

342
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,870
You can do it, Ty!

343
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,410
All right.

344
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:42,430
All right.

345
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,390
All right.

346
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,370
So you're leaving it up to me to get this
gate open, huh?

347
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,870
And whatever I decide is the best way,
you're all willing to go along with it?

348
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,990
Uh-huh.

349
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,570
Well, I've decided I want Izzy to do it.

350
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,270
What?

351
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,110
You do?

352
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,170
Why me?

353
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,130
If that's what Ty thinks, I accept it.

354
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,830
Me too.

355
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:05,990
Don't worry, Izzy.

356
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,070
Ty believes in you and so do the rest of
us.

357
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,850
But what happens if I'm wrong?

358
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,110
No one will blame you.

359
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,470
We all know you're the right one for the
job, Izzy.

360
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,590
Go for it.

361
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,450
I still have no idea how this all fits
together.

362
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,290
Maybe you could use your computer to help
figure it out.

363
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,310
The computer?

364
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,485
Well, right now I'd rather
use it to log onto the

365
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:26,031
internet and book us
a flight out of this place.

366
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,620
Huh?

367
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,700
Wait a minute.

368
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,940
The horse, the lion, and then the monkey!

369
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
That's it!

370
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,280
Remember, all Digimon can be classified as
data, virus, or vaccine.

371
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Could it be?

372
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,020
Who here has met up with Digitamamon and
Gekomon?

373
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,980
I have.

374
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,400
Give me your Digivice.

375
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,420
Bro-digis!

376
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,660
You figured it out?

377
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,240
I think I might have.

378
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,080
Come on, guys.

379
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Check this out.

380
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,920
The first three, the lion, the archer,
and the monkey, would be Leomon,

381
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,000
Centaruman, and Edemon.

382
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,880
In addition, there's one of each
classification.

383
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,820
Data, virus, and vaccine.

384
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,780
The stars, starting at the top, represent
in-training, rookie, and champion.

385
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
So now we can put all the cards in the
right squares.

386
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:19,960
You did it, Izzy.

387
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,460
Good work.

388
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,780
We knew you'd figure it out.

389
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,620
Wait a minute.

390
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Not so fast.

391
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,640
There are two cards here.

392
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,260
One of them is the fake, but I don't know
which one.

393
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
So that's it.

394
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,380
I'm sorry.

395
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,820
We still can't be certain where the gate
will open to.

396
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:35,520
But we made it this far.

397
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
That's great.

398
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,780
Yes, it is.

399
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,820
I can pick which one's fake.

400
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,980
If I can't, everyone gets an ice cream,
and I buy it.

401
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Huh?

402
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,220
I'll tell you in just a minute.

403
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,820
It's Dogugumon, an evil Digimon with
computer virus parasites covering his body.

404
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,520
Intruders in the castle must be destroyed.

405
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,840
Don't get them!

406
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,780
Digimon, digital monsters.

407
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,340
Digimon are the champions.

408
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,820
Dogumon, Digiball too!

409
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Ikakuma!

410
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,980
Kalamon, Digiball too!

411
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Kalamon!

412
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Kalamon!

413
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,680
Digiball too!

414
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Kaluruma!

415
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Digimon!

416
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,100
Blue Blaster!

417
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,120
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

418
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
We're running!

419
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,380
Which one is the fake card?

420
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Hurry up!

421
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,360
Choose!

422
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,180
If I choose wrong, we're toast!

423
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,120
Poison Thread!

424
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:39,900
The monsters too!

425
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
The champions!

426
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,400
Monster friends to the boys and girls!

427
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,060
Hey, Digimon, hey, Digimon!

428
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,380
Ty, you've got to make up your mind now!

429
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
We're out of time!

430
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Okay!

431
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,140
It's this one!

432
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,880
Monster friends to the boys and girls!

433
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:20,720
Hey, Digimon, hey, Digimon!

434
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,550
It was real close, Zoonomon, but it looks
like we made it!

435
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,270
It looks like we made it!

436
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,110
Where are we?

437
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,350
I know this place!

438
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,570
This is the summer camp where we all met!

439
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,770
You did it, Ty!

440
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,910
We're home again!

441
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,970
We're back to where we were first sucked
into the digital world!

442
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,690
But where are our Digimon?

443
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,450
I wonder if we got the cards wrong after
all!

444
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,330
Then in this world, we could be without
them!

445
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,850
You can't get rid of a study, Ty!

446
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,270
Wake up!

447
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,450
Come on, sleepyheads!

448
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,250
We're up!

449
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,790
We're up!

450
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,630
Where have you been?

451
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,790
We thought we ought to go look for a
little lunch!

452
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,310
Now that we're home, we don't have to eat
leaves anymore!

453
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,590
We can eat cheeseburgers!

454
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,170
That's right!

455
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,350
And pepperoni pizza!

456
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,170
And french fries!

457
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:40,890
And ice cream!

458
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,410
Yeah, and broccoli!

459
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,510
Broccoli?

460
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,070
Broccoli?

461
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,530
How did you know that my card was the
fake, Ty?

462
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,531
I didn't!

463
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,110
I kept your card because you're my friend!

464
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,710
That's so nice!

465
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,610
Hey, everybody!

466
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,830
We've got to go and find the eighth child!

467
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,230
Yeah!

468
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,490
And we've got to get a move on since my
Otismond's there ahead of us!

469
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,530
I'm happy that we're finally headed back
to my hometown!

470
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,751
And we already know that's where we're
going to find the eighth child!

471
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,170
Let's go!
