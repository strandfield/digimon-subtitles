1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
So there we were, falling like crazy.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,686
That's when Gomamon
tells all the fish in the river

3
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:08,381
to swim close together
and make a boat for us.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,960
Later, we find a beach with a whole bunch
of these foam booths.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,560
We tried calling home, but none of them
seemed to work.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,520
Next, we got totally thrashed on by
Shellmon.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,880
He sprayed seawater like a fire hose.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,280
My butt, Agumon, got stepped on,
and that made him mad.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,640
We digivolved into Greymon and gave
Shellmon a ride he won't forget.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,480
Then he turned back into Agumon.

11
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,320
Dudes, this place is wild!

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,460
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,660
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,000
Change into digital champions to save the
digital world!

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,140
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Digimon!

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Digital monsters!

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,280
Digimon are the champions!

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
Digimon!

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,450
Digimon!

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,650
Digital monsters!

22
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,090
Digimon are the champions!

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Digimon!

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,860
We've almost searched the whole island and
we still haven't found any people.

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,660
Just some monsters with attitude.

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,240
But they couldn't beat our Digimon friends
who can turn into these awesome fighters.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,880
Like when Agumon Digivolved into Greymon
and kicked Shellmon to the curb.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,180
He was so cool!

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,620
Yo, Agumon!

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
What's up, Ty?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
I like it when you're Greymon.

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,120
No offense, but why don't you just stay
that way?

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
I can't.

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,420
But even superheroes need a rest.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,700
Who's that Digimon?

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,900
It's a monochromon, but don't worry about
him.

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,100
He's a laid-back Digimon.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,665
Although it is wise to be a bit
cautious with the monochromon,

39
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,180
they do tend to get a bit
miffed when they're hungry.

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,980
Then he must be starving, because he looks
really mad!

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,140
And I think he wants to eat us!

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,500
There are two of them!

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,740
We're caught between a rock and two sets
of teeth!

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,020
We're caught between a rock and two sets
of teeth!

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,700
Something must have set those monochromon
off!

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,100
They're fighting over territory!

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,100
They can just have it then!

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,340
Hey!

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,400
Don't leave without me!

50
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,700
They definitely don't need us hanging
around!

51
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
I

52
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,220
don't walk this much unless I'm at a mall!

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
And as you can see, we're nowhere near
one!

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
Mimi, stop whining!

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:29,900
No!

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
My feet hurt!

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,360
Maybe if you'd take off your boots and
socks, you'd feel better, Mimi.

58
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,280
It's much more practical, I think.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,540
I'm not walking and dirty my bare feet!

60
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,160
I love the feel of dirt under my feet,
especially between my toes!

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Gross!

62
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,580
It appears that we may be losing our light
source.

63
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,160
What a weird sunset.

64
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,120
This whole island is weird, and who knows
what will come out at night!

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,480
Wait!

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,380
I detect water!

67
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,860
Stay here while I check it out!

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,820
Yes!

69
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
As usual, I'm right!

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,280
It's a lake with fresh, clean water and a
variety of tasty fish!

71
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,780
It's a perfect campsite!

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,020
Maybe I can finally soak my poor achy
feet!

73
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,680
Yay!

74
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
We get to swim!

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,260
Go, Maman!

76
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,220
You better wait and make sure it's safe
first!

77
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,320
That's why I think we should keep walking
and stop all the complaining!

78
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,860
Everybody's hungry!

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,180
We have to find some food!

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
That is a good plan!

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,520
I like that plan a lot!

82
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,480
It should be safe to rest here tonight!

83
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,600
Yeah, I love camping outside!

84
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,120
If I won't walk in dirt, what makes you
think I'll sleep in it?

85
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,860
Mimi, do you see a hotel here?

86
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Whoa!

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
What's that?

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,620
It looks like a trolley car!

89
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,620
That's odd!

90
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,540
The lights just... came on!

91
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,760
Well, maybe there are some real people in
there!

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Let's check it out!

93
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,676
Maybe they can take us back home!

94
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,780
In air-conditioned comfort!

95
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
Mimi, wait up!

96
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,480
Bummer, it's empty!

97
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
Totally empty!

98
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,560
No trolley cars this clean!

99
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,360
Oh, goody!

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,600
These cushions are comfy!

101
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Something's wrong!

102
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,640
Remember those weird phone booths we saw
on the beach?

103
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,780
Something just as freaky could happen
here!

104
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,160
Yeah, like this suddenly moving all by
itself!

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Possibly, but then again, maybe that's how
we're going to get home!

106
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,680
So we have nothing to lose by staying
here!

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,820
Oh, can we eat now?

108
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,020
That's right.

109
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
I forgot.

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Go, Momon!

111
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,780
Stop playing in the water!

112
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,440
I can't catch any fish if you keep on
warning them away!

113
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,160
Yum, yum!

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,180
You can't get too many berries down the
hatch!

115
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Oh!

116
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,260
Oh boy, you better watch that killer
breath of yours, Pot-Omon!

117
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,240
Those are bad mushrooms!

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,220
You shouldn't pick them!

119
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,640
They'll make you sick!

120
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Oh!

121
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,940
I'd be a big mess without you,
Palmon!

122
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
You're the best!

123
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,540
Hasta!

124
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,260
We're all set to cook dinner!

125
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,840
Now all we need is the grub!

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,920
Great, but how are we supposed to light
the fire?

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Like this!

128
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,300
Wow, Agumon!

129
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
You're the man!

130
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Aww!

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
Hey, look it!

132
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,040
We caught a bunch of fish!

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,520
Awesome, Izzy!

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,180
Let's eat them!

135
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Thanks, Squirt!

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,860
This is where I wish we had a microwave!

137
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,220
Huh?

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,820
Me too!

139
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,716
Because you're about to lose your fingers!

140
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,780
Why don't you use a stick?

141
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,460
How did you come up with that,
Matt?

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,100
Because I'm the man!

143
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,460
This is surprisingly good!

144
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Mmm!

145
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,780
Delicious!

146
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,160
Matt, Mom only lets me eat fish sticks!

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,180
I won't tell!

148
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,580
I'll never eat with my fingers!

149
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,740
TK, it's alright!

150
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah, you're hanging with the big boys
now!

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Kay!

152
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,880
Hey, Sora!

153
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,240
What?

154
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,440
Matt doesn't treat TK like a brother,
only like he's a bother!

155
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,700
Is it just me, or have you noticed that
too?

156
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,040
Yeah.

157
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,416
I wonder... Matt's still
learning to be a big brother!

158
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Maybe.

159
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,080
Hmm... Hey, Joe!

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,940
Whatcha looking at?

161
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,968
I'm trying to figure out
which direction we've

162
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,120
been going, but the stars
seem to be all mixed up!

163
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,420
I haven't been able to find the North Star
anywhere!

164
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,240
I know!

165
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,580
I don't recognize any of these
constellations!

166
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,060
You're forgetting your astronomy!

167
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:16,860
If you can't see the North Star, then it
must be on the other side of the world!

168
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,380
Do you think we could be in the Southern
Hemisphere?

169
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,160
Yes, I guess it's possible!

170
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,680
That is, if we're still on Earth!

171
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,380
What is that supposed to mean?

172
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Look!

173
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,801
Panamon's tired!

174
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,280
I'm getting really tired myself!

175
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,720
Wait a second!

176
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,660
I think we should take turns standing
guard!

177
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,280
Alright!

178
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Who wants to go first?

179
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,040
How about if each of us stands guard for
about an hour?

180
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,160
Not TK!

181
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,360
Aw, come on!

182
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
Me too, Matt!

183
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,620
No!

184
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,760
You're too young and you need your rest!

185
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
I'm getting cold!

186
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
I need a warm blanket to help me sleep!

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,140
Hey, Gabumon!

188
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,920
Watch it!

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,280
Mimi may sneak up on you and steal your
fur, so if you feel a little tugged,

190
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,260
it might be her about to cut your tail
off!

191
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,340
Stop talking!

192
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,220
That's not funny!

193
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:03,680
Quit it!

194
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,460
What are you bugging about?

195
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,020
Gabumon told you to stop!

196
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,300
So knock it off!

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,280
Hey, you can't tell me what to do!

198
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,240
You guys stop fighting!

199
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,860
You'd both make great guards!

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,540
Who goes first?

201
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,420
I will!

202
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
I'm next!

203
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,340
How about if Izzy takes over after that
and then I finish up the night?

204
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:27,860
I propose that the rest of us trek back to
the bus and get some shut-eye!

205
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,690
I can't sleep with all of you here!

206
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,170
Quit complaining!

207
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,470
So it's not perfect!

208
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,290
Just be glad we have a place to sleep!

209
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,490
That's right, Mimi!

210
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:41,950
Good night!

211
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,970
Don't let the monochrome on bite!

212
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,830
Thanks for reminding me, TK!

213
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,370
My feet still hurt!

214
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,730
Why is there a trolley here?

215
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,010
Maybe it's the aliens!

216
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,830
Maybe they knew we needed it!

217
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,070
I hope I don't get any monster cooties!

218
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,840
Gabumon?

219
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,300
Yeah?

220
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,380
Go over and lay down with my brother!

221
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,200
Why, Matt?

222
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,020
Because your fur's making me sweat!

223
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,620
Now go!

224
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,880
Because you want me to keep TK warm!

225
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
Hey, I didn't say that!

226
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
You just don't want to admit it!

227
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Whatever!

228
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Thanks, Matt!

229
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,240
Ty, you don't want to fall asleep on your
first night watch!

230
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
My eyes won't stay open!

231
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,360
I'm going to the lake and splash some
water on my face!

232
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Huh?

233
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Who's there?

234
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
Oh, Matt!

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
Don't you think I can handle this?

236
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:54,680
I couldn't sleep!

237
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,200
Oh!

238
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
And why not?

239
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
Look, I'm sorry about earlier!

240
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,940
I didn't mean to get so mad, it's just
being here and having to watch TK!

241
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,940
Do you guys even live in the same house?

242
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Not anymore!

243
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,200
We're half-brothers and we don't get to
see each other much!

244
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
Well, that explains a lot!

245
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:10,320
Matt...

246
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,140
Oh!

247
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
Huh?

248
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,140
Matt's a little strange.

249
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Huh?

250
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,480
What a wonderful sound!

251
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,180
Maybe to a St. Bernard with a horn on his
forehead.

252
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
Hmm...

253
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,470
Huh?

254
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,310
Oh!

255
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,950
Watch out for the fire sparks!

256
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,810
What's that horrible sound?

257
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,770
It's an earthquake!

258
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,530
The trolley's starting to move and I don't
think it's taking us home!

259
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,270
It's taking us toward that sea dragon!

260
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,790
Oh no!

261
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,130
Sea Drummond!

262
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,390
We're gonna get eaten for sure!

263
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,760
The land's moving!

264
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,200
Hold tight!

265
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
We're going for a ride!

266
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,600
It's like we're on a monster longboard!

267
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:03,020
He's pulling us along by his tail!

268
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,160
I don't even think he realizes we're here!

269
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,100
Perhaps not!

270
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
He's a bit dense!

271
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,760
As long as he doesn't see us, we should be
safe!

272
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,360
Don't be too sure!

273
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,940
You guys jinxed us!

274
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,440
Now he knows we're here!

275
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,160
What?

276
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I didn't do anything!

277
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,120
Whoa!

278
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,560
Guess he does know we're here!

279
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
The

280
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
red thing was his tail!

281
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,950
It wasn't my fault!

282
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,920
He's coming back and he's not happy!

283
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:47,980
Here!

284
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,420
T.K!

285
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,920
Matt, I'm just letting you know my fur's
gonna get wet and I'm gonna stink!

286
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Great!

287
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,550
He left us right in the middle of the
lake!

288
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,690
I don't suppose we could trick him into
taking us back!

289
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,210
Get ready!

290
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,390
He's attacking!

291
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,670
Come on, you guys!

292
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,530
Let's send him back to the fishies!

293
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,531
No problem!

294
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,850
Viral Twister!

295
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,050
Ah!

296
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,430
Pleasimany!

297
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,770
Super Shocker!

298
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,550
Peppa Breath!

299
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,170
Agumon!

300
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,090
Digivolve!

301
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,690
I've been trying, but I can't seem to do
it this time!

302
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,030
Ty?

303
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,410
You have to!

304
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,570
Maybe my body hasn't recovered from the
last fight!

305
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,410
But if you can't help us, how are we gonna
stop Seedramon?

306
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,411
Take him!

307
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,490
Over here!

308
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,110
Matt!

309
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:45,170
Matt!

310
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:46,171
Be careful!

311
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
Go, Momon!

312
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:53,900
Go!

313
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Hurry up, Matt!

314
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,380
Get out fast!

315
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,300
It's Seedramon!

316
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:57,960
He's back!

317
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,280
Go, Momon!

318
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,120
You can do it!

319
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Right!

320
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Hey!

321
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
New blaster!

322
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Ha!

323
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,800
It's all my fault!

324
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,400
Matt was only trying to save me!

325
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,920
I'll never forgive myself!

326
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:22,960
No!

327
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Oh, no!

328
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,960
This is not good!

329
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,241
Seedramon may be a bubble brain, but
once he finds his prey, he won't let go!

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,100
Matt!

331
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Hang on!

332
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,840
Seedramon's way too big!

333
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,620
I just don't have enough power now!

334
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,200
Gobblemon, you're stronger!

335
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,860
How about you?

336
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,740
You're right!

337
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
Matt is in trouble, and I must help!

338
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,520
Gobblemon!

339
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,020
Hey!

340
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Don't give up!

341
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,940
I'll find a way to save you,
but the last thing I do... Matt!

342
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,440
Matt!

343
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:57,441
Hold on!

344
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,840
I don't understand any of this,
but I have to save Matt!

345
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,480
What's a little stinky fur compared to a
friend like him?

346
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,050
Gobblemon!

347
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,870
Ah!

348
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,410
Gobblemon!

349
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,790
Ah!

350
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,791
Digiball 2!

351
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,810
Gobblemon!

352
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,890
Yeah, but where's Gobblemon?

353
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,891
Shhh!

354
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,420
Garurumon's fur is legendary!

355
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
It's strong as steel!

356
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,500
He's like a growling torpedo!

357
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
That's astonishing!

358
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Mini must be invincible!

359
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,060
Well, that's what I've heard anyway!

360
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,460
We'll soon find out!

361
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,743
I hope you're not
exaggerating, Tento-mon,

362
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:27,221
with another one of
your wild fish tails again!

363
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,060
He could be!

364
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,300
But I heard about it!

365
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:29,880
Roar!

366
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Roar!

367
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:34,960
Roar!

368
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,800
Roar!

369
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,440
Roar!

370
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,000
Roar!

371
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,780
Roar!

372
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Roar!

373
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,030
Roar!

374
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,230
Roar!

375
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,290
Roar!

376
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,630
Roar!

377
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:24,352
Flying's sure a good way to keep my fur
dry!

378
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,410
You digivolved into Garurumon just in
time!

379
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,310
Oh, Gobblemon, thanks for saving my
brother!

380
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,210
Any time, little friend!

381
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,130
Matt, you were so awesome against that
monster!

382
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,590
You think so?

383
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,190
You know, you were the man!

384
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,850
And you're the wolf man!

385
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,910
Okay, very funny, but how are we supposed
to get back?

386
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,070
Just watch!

387
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Gobblemon,

388
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,100
may I use your fur pillow?

389
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,320
I promise, I won't take your fur!

390
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Actually, there seems to be a pattern
here.

391
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,840
This time, only Gobblemon could digivolve.

392
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,420
Yeah, Izzy's right!

393
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,460
Gobblemon was the only one who could do it
before!

394
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Hmm...

395
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Hang on!

396
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I can't breathe!

397
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Greymon!

398
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,740
Get me out of here!

399
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,840
You're right, it's all beginning to make
sense!

400
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,340
Agumon digivolved when I was in danger!

401
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,240
That has to be the answer!

402
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,120
Our Digimon digivolves when we're in
trouble!

403
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,500
Wow, that must be it!

404
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,560
Hey, watch it!

405
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,460
Is it time to go to the mall?

406
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,700
We've been here one day and I think she's
put some muscle on her.

407
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,114
Yeah, maybe if she
puts in some effort,

408
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,360
she'll become a hard-bodied
machine like I am!

409
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,820
I hope she grows pink wings just like my
wings!

410
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,440
You must be kidding!

411
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,300
Oh!

412
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Oh!

413
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Oh!

414
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Oh!

415
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Oh!

416
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,220
Oh, big bro!

417
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:34,600
Oh, you're the best.
