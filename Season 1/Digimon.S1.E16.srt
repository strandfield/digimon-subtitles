1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,693
After reaching the continent
of Server, we found a

2
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:05,600
Koromon village, but it was
occupied by the Pogomon.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,960
Later, during dinner, Poyomon digivolved
to Tokomon.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,840
That night, little Toko was taken from our
campsite.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,140
Agumon finally found him and all the
Koromon in a cave.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,920
They were being guarded by the Gazimon,
who were also planning on giving us to

7
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:21,860
their leader, that rock and roll digi-jerk
Edimon.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,980
He used his music like a weapon and tried
to destroy the village.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,700
We found the crest for Tai's tag,
and it created an escape for us.

10
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,080
Never a dull moment.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,800
Digimon, digital

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,980
monsters, Digimon are the champions!

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,120
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,540
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

15
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,621
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

16
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,330
Until Edimon can't follow us anymore.

17
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,290
I don't think there is such a place!

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,730
We certainly can't stop here in the middle
of nowhere.

19
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,090
For one thing, if we were attacked,
there'd be no place for us to run to.

20
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,190
This is starting to look bad.

21
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,510
Everyone's becoming so timid and afraid.

22
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,890
Hey, come on, you guys.

23
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,230
Why'd we stop?

24
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,430
Why is everyone so scared?

25
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,950
After all, we do have the crest,
you know?

26
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,810
That's true, but do we really know the
crest will help Agumon to digivolve?

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,530
Of course.

28
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,670
Right, Agumon?

29
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,050
Hmm?

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,930
Listen, buddy, this is your big chance.

31
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,670
Don't let me down.

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,350
You're the only one that can digivolve
further, so either you try to get to the

33
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:14,150
next level and save us from Edamon,
or I'll go and get myself a new Digimon.

34
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,830
Not much of a choice.

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,030
Arrgh!

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,170
By the way, how are we supposed to use the
crest to digivolve again?

37
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,260
Well, from what we've
seen so far with the

38
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,230
other digivolutions, it
takes a lot of energy.

39
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,670
For example, they can't digivolve if
they're hungry.

40
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,750
In addition, the partner of the Digimon
must be in some sort of danger.

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,450
You know, like being under attack or
something.

42
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,838
But since it's a higher
level of digivolving,

43
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,650
my theory is even
more energy is needed.

44
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,590
So we'll provide the food, Edamon will
provide the danger.

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,290
You better watch out, you digidescent
kids.

46
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,190
I'll find you.

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,630
And when I do, you'll wish you'll never
cross, Edamon.

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,770
I'll get you.

49
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,670
Hey, no more.

50
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,790
Just one more teensy bite.

51
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,970
Ready for the second course?

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,250
Oh, stop your belly aching and open wide.

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,550
You've got to keep on eating.

54
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,490
Listen, everyone's giving you their food
so that you can digivolve.

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,470
Isn't that right?

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,230
Yeah.

57
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,710
We didn't give him our food.

58
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,550
He took it from us.

59
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,430
Of all the nerve.

60
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:15,330
Well, the food won't do us any good.

61
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,830
We still can't digivolve.

62
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,870
So those of us who don't work don't eat,
huh?

63
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,010
But I'm hungry.

64
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,710
Hey, I can't hear you.

65
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,870
I said, is that right?

66
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,310
That's right.

67
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,010
See, that's why you've got to try your
best to protect everybody.

68
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,370
Now, come on, buddy.

69
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Keep eating.

70
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,170
I guess there's not much else we can do to
help.

71
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,650
I don't know if Agumon can take much more.

72
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,550
Yeah, Tai is really pushing him.

73
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,470
Agumon's stuffed like a Thanksgiving
turkey.

74
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,870
Eat up.

75
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,870
You need that energy.

76
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,610
Tai's personality has taken a turn for the
worse lately.

77
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,170
I remember him being friendlier even to us
younger kids.

78
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,650
Actually, now that you mention it,
he was cool during soccer camp.

79
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,270
Tai, pass it to me.

80
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,430
I'm open.

81
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,350
Now's my chance to shoot.

82
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,470
Here I go.

83
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,290
Nice pass, Tai.

84
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,550
I thought you were going to take the shot
yourself.

85
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,470
Remember, there's no I in team.

86
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,250
Tai might look like he's trying to run
things all by himself, but whatever crazy

87
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:24,810
action he takes, he does it for the good
of the team.

88
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:25,310
Uh-huh.

89
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,010
But now all this...

90
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,850
We're the only ones who can help now.

91
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,930
So you've got to keep eating, okay,
Agumon?

92
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,130
I can't.

93
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,172
Tai's personality seems
to have changed ever

94
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:38,430
since he got a hold of
that crest of courage.

95
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,790
Boy, I'm hungry.

96
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,210
Hmm?

97
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,510
Hey, guys.

98
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,230
My tag is blowing.

99
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,010
It must be reacting to something.

100
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,810
The crest must be nearby.

101
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,370
You think so?

102
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,930
Hey, look!

103
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,690
There's something out there.

104
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,970
It looks like a big building or something.

105
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,350
That must be where my crest is.

106
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,470
Whoa!

107
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,810
What's a cable doing out in the middle of
nowhere?

108
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,190
Whoa!

109
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,870
What is it, Lord Edelon?

110
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,190
Ha-ha-ha!

111
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,070
Something's caught in my network.

112
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,310
Ha-ha-ha.

113
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,130
The intruders in the L7 sector.

114
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,190
Let's see.

115
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,170
L7, L7.

116
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,310
How's this thing work?

117
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,430
Oh, here it is.

118
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,130
Where is it?

119
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,610
Ha-ha-ha!

120
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,050
It's near the Coliseum.

121
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,370
That's where I hold my annual Tribute to
Me show.

122
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,406
I wonder what they're doing all the way
over there.

123
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,430
You got any idea?

124
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,590
Well, maybe they want to get good seats,
boss.

125
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,710
Oh, we'll have a perfect view for the
surprise show I've planted for them.

126
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,950
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

127
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,660
Hello, Area L7.

128
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Can I help you?

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,560
It's Edelon.

130
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,660
Yes, sir.

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, little bunny.

132
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,740
You should be having some guests soon.

133
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,460
You better get ready to welcome them.

134
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,520
Welcome them?

135
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,780
So do you mean...

136
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Bingo, bunny.

137
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,300
As you wish, sir.

138
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,360
Amazing.

139
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,160
It looks like the Roman Coliseum.

140
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,300
What's the Roman Coliseum?

141
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,700
Well, Tentomon, it's an ancient arena.

142
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,860
But the ancient one didn't have big
screens.

143
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,260
Or soccer goals.

144
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,720
Okay, guys, let's all split up and look
for the crest.

145
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,380
What's wrong?

146
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,720
I can't move anymore.

147
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,440
Let me rest for a little bit.

148
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,000
Come on, get up!

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
You can do it!

150
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,660
I can't!

151
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Give him a rest, Ty.

152
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,200
Hm?

153
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,240
The only clue we have is my tag.

154
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,460
So Gumamod and I will search for the
crest.

155
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,780
You guys relax for a while.

156
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,140
Later!

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Wait, I'll go with you!

158
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,340
A soccer ball!

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,100
Hey, anybody up for a game?

160
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,440
Yeah, that sounds fun!

161
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
That's a great idea.

162
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,860
The human team will play against the
Digimon team.

163
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,580
What on earth is soccer?

164
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,200
It's easy.

165
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,960
You use your feet to try to get this ball
into the goal.

166
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,120
You can also use your chest or your head.

167
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,700
Here I go!

168
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,820
Oh, that's really using your head.

169
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,220
Oh, and I forgot to tell you, you can't
use your hands.

170
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,480
Unless you're the goalkeeper, then you can
touch the ball with your hands.

171
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,940
Yeah, you should be the goalie for your
team, Palmon.

172
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Here!

173
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Huh?

174
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,920
I can't believe you're playing soccer at a
time like this.

175
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,536
Will you use your heads for something
other than hitting the ball?

176
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,920
The sooner Joe finds the crest,
the sooner we can leave.

177
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,500
Your tag is reacting again.

178
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Yeah.

179
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,460
The crest must be around here somewhere.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Huh?

181
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,860
Who's the king?

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,520
Oh!

183
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,440
He's here!

184
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Ekumon's here!

185
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Hey!

186
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Wait for me!

187
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Agumon!

188
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,560
Hey!

189
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
We're trapped!

190
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Gold!

191
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,520
I sure did it!

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I scored a gold!

193
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,860
The whole thing was a trap!

194
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,520
Does he really think he can trap us with a
simple...

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,300
Now, now, listen up!

196
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,940
If you do that, you might get hurt.

197
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,500
You see, there's electricity running
through that net.

198
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,320
It's a shocker, I know it.

199
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,740
I really wanted to be there in person to
do this myself, but I'm way too busy.

200
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,920
You know how us rock and roll legends are.

201
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,080
But don't worry, the axe substituting for
me is a very rare treat.

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,214
Let's see if you can
put your puny little heads

203
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:54,040
together and figure out
who our special guest star is.

204
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,041
Well?

205
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,780
How would we know who it is?

206
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,500
I'm sure you'll be surprised.

207
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
Here he comes!

208
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,780
It's a different Grey Moth!

209
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,300
Hey, I knew you'd be surprised.

210
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,020
I'm so evil.

211
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,940
Let's get started.

212
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,800
It's time to go.

213
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,140
Okay, here's the show.

214
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,220
It's time to Digivolve!

215
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,730
Digimon!

216
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,230
You've

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,380
got to Digivolve!

218
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,560
Boy, this doesn't look good.

219
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,240
We're done for if you can't Digivolve
again!

220
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,920
Digivolve, Greymon, you've got to!

221
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,760
What's he waiting for?

222
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,620
Why won't he Digivolve to the next level?

223
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,800
It's not working, Ty.

224
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,360
The crust isn't reacting at all.

225
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,040
Maybe you gave him too much to eat.

226
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,640
Maybe he can't Digivolve.

227
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,040
Of course he can!

228
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,500
Come on, Greymon, you can do it!

229
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,760
Believe in your power and you can
Digivolve!

230
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,180
Way to go, Greymon!

231
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Nova Blast!

232
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,140
He certainly doesn't have any Digimanners.

233
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,460
At least they excuse me.

234
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,500
Am I imagining it or is he moving a lot
slower than usual?

235
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,380
He consumed way too much so his reflexes
are sluggish.

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
You're right, Izzy.

237
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:24,940
Ow!

238
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
Not again.

239
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,920
Get up and fight!

240
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,260
It's looking like this is going to be over
sooner than I thought.

241
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,440
You silly rabbits stop carrying on like a
trained seal.

242
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,440
Get the fireworks ready so I can celebrate
my victory!

243
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Yes, sir!

244
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,250
We need help!

245
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,370
Watching fishes!

246
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,620
Where did those fish come from?

247
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,760
How could they just come out of there like
that?

248
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,760
I don't know, but if it's not broken,
don't fix it!

249
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,580
It's really elementary, Joe.

250
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,300
There's probably just a dimensional vortex
rift in the water.

251
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:21,860
Ditto!

252
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Oh.

253
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,800
Thank you, fish!

254
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,020
Now, what are we going to do to get out of
here?

255
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,160
We should dig a hole and tunnel our way
out.

256
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Good idea.

257
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
There's a black cable here, too.

258
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,420
This rock is in the way.

259
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
My tag.

260
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,340
It's... It's reacting again.

261
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,180
What if this rock is the crest we've been
looking for?

262
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,420
If this really is the crest that goes with
my tag, then maybe...

263
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,630
It is my crest!

264
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,230
Yes!

265
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,550
Look, a tunnel!

266
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,090
We can get out through here!

267
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,710
How do you like that?

268
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,050
Not only did those little darlings escape,
but they found another crest, too.

269
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,390
This is unforgivable!

270
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,670
Greymon, you could win if you'd only
digivolve!

271
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,230
Greymon!

272
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,790
Ty, don't!

273
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,650
Don't stop me!

274
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,270
This is my chance to make him digivolve to
the next level!

275
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,270
Please mind your own business,
Sora!

276
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,870
But Ty, without a reaction from the crest,
there's no way for him to digivolve!

277
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,370
I can make him do it!

278
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,530
Watch!

279
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,670
What do you think he's gonna do?

280
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,290
The other condition for digivolving is
their partner must be in danger.

281
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,550
He wouldn't!

282
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,910
Hurry up and finish him off!

283
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,730
Use your Nova Blast!

284
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,350
Stop!

285
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,620
You!

286
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Okay, fire breath!

287
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Come and get me!

288
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,760
What do we have here?

289
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,260
A dope who thinks he's a superstar?

290
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,380
You got it!

291
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,140
Now start singing your final number!

292
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Mm-hmm!

293
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Ah!

294
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,260
Be-o-mon, you've got to help Ty!

295
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,760
You go too, Gob-o-mon!

296
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Got it!

297
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:55,480
U-mon!

298
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
Digivolve to...

299
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,330
Greymon, I believe in you!

300
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,310
You can do it, Greymon!

301
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,910
Digivolve!

302
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,400
What do you think that is?

303
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,620
Oh, my!

304
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,140
Is that what I think it is?

305
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,940
What do you call that thing?

306
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,220
Skull Greymon!

307
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,780
The sight of him makes other Digimon
tremble!

308
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,538
He is a fully digivolved
Digimon whose explosive

309
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:13,161
power causes him to
constantly search for battle!

310
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,860
This could be very bad!

311
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,060
There's been some mistake and he's
digivolved into a horrible monster!

312
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,940
This is Greymon's digivolved form?

313
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
No!

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No!

315
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,590
No!

316
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,870
No!

317
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,630
Listen to me, Skull Greymon!

318
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,110
If you're really the Digivolve form of
Greymon, then you can't hurt me!

319
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,710
Ty, get out of there!

320
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,570
Leave it to me!

321
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,140
Tentermon Digivolve to...

322
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,110
Gabu Terrimon!

323
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,450
Digimon?

324
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Oh, no!

325
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,490
Oh, no, my poor network!

326
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,770
They're destroying everything that I
worked so hard to create!

327
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:37,771
Oh!

328
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,680
Golden Bluster!

329
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
ElectroShocker!

330
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,610
I savagely attacked three of my fellow
Digimons.

331
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,990
It wasn't your fault.

332
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,650
She's right.

333
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,310
We completely understand.

334
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,790
I'm really sorry I didn't live up to your
expectations of me, Tai.

335
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,010
It's not your fault.

336
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,130
I know who's to blame.

337
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:14,850
I know.

338
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,710
It's all my fault.

339
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,890
I'm really, really sorry.

340
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,030
I didn't mean to put it all on you,
Tai.

341
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,850
It's okay.

342
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,650
It's my fault.

343
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,330
Right, Sora?

344
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:21,950
Yeah.

345
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,630
I mean... I didn't know what I was doing,
but I kept pushing people around anyway.

346
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,741
I felt like because I had the
crest, I had to be in charge

347
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:31,570
and fight on my own without
any help from the rest of you.

348
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,490
I'm sorry, everybody.

349
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,010
Please forgive me.

350
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,130
You were finally able to Digivolve,
but it was a huge mistake.

351
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,350
I wonder if our Digimon will ever be able
to Digivolve the right way.

352
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,090
One thing's for sure, I learned my lesson.

353
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,611
Okay, so I'll be asking that for more.

354
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,010
Oh, I had to go.

355
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:04,370
Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,890
We got to go.

357
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:06,230
Oh, my God.

358
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,231
Oh, my God.
