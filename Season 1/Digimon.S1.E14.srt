1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
We finally found TK, and just in time,
too.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,000
Later, Devamon channeled his power and
became enormous.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,840
No matter how many times they tried,
our Digimon couldn't stop him.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,540
That's when the incredible happened.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,379
Patamon finally digivolved
into Angemon, and

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,060
using all of his energy,
defeated Devamon.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,540
With all of his strength gone, Angemon
returned to the youngest stage, a Digi-Egg.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,100
With Devamon gone, File Island began to
rebuild itself.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm just glad we're all back together
again.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Digimon!

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,980
Digital Monsters!

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,400
Digimon are the champions!

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,800
Change into Digital Champions 2!

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,020
Save the digital world!

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,380
Digimon!

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,660
Digital Monsters!

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,040
Digimon are the champions!

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,580
Digimon!

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,280
Digimon!

20
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:05,820
Digital Monsters!

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
Digimon are the champions!

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,380
Digimon!

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,620
Digital Monsters!

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,040
Digimon are the champions!

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Digimon!

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,360
After the Digimon defeated Devamon,
we thought the worst was over.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,780
And then, a mysterious being appeared
before us.

28
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,260
So, you children are the Digi-destined.

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,340
You must be strong to have defeated
Devimon.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Who are you?

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,400
Are you a friend of Devimon's?

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,220
Fear not, for I am a friend to all,
and yet I am a friend to none.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I can't believe it.

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,100
There are actually other humans besides us
in this world.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
I am human, and yet I am not human.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
This is confusing.

37
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,380
No, my name is Jani.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,000
I couldn't send you this transmission
during your battle with Devimon,

39
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,820
but now the lines are clear and only ten
cents a minute.

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Well, who are you?

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,460
And just where are you?

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,974
I am speaking to you
far away from Fire Island,

43
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,941
across the ocean on
the continent of Surba.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Talk about a long-distance call.

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,796
How long have you been here?

46
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,220
Since before the beginning until after the
end.

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,080
Are you the one who got us stuck here in
the digital world?

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
It was not I.

49
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Then who was it?

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,600
It was... I don't know.

51
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,481
But Mr. Jani, sir, do you know what we need
to do so we can all get back home again?

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,140
No, I don't.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Boy, you're a regular fountain of
information, aren't you?

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm sorry I can't help you, but you can be
of help to me.

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,960
How?

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,580
How?

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,800
Please come to Surba and defeat our
enemies.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,460
As the Digidists and I have faith in all
of you.

59
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,160
That's crazy when we don't know your exact
location.

60
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:00,161
Good point.

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,720
I forgot you're from out of town.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,100
Let me create a map for you on your
computer.

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,620
Huh?

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,080
What?

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,480
What if your enemies are humongazoid?

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,820
Do you think we can beat anything tougher
than Debamon?

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,596
Not presently, but
if your Digimon can

68
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,060
digivolve once more,
you might be able to do it.

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,760
So we can digivolve even more?

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,580
But you'll need something special to do
it.

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,641
If you have the tags and crests, your Digimon
will be able to digivolve even further.

72
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,680
Please tell us where we can find these
tags and crests.

73
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,963
When the crests are
scattered about, you can

74
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:35,560
locate them all throughout
the continent of Surba.

75
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,460
And the tags were secretly sealed away
somewhere by Debamon.

76
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,160
Oh no, Debamon, oh no!

77
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,520
You must come!

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,580
What's going on?

79
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:47,720
Hey!

80
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,600
Come, quickly!

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
I'll be waiting!

82
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm savored!

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
He's gone!

84
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,840
What was that?

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,880
Jedi's transmission ended rather abruptly.

86
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,920
Well, at least he was able to send the map
through before he got cut off.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
I hope he's alright.

88
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,040
What's our next move going to be?

89
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:08,960
Huh.

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
I've got a foolproof plan.

91
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,000
First we'll eat something, and after that
I'm open to suggestions.

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,180
That was delicious!

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,760
I was so hungry!

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
Now that my stomach is full, I'm ready for
lunch!

95
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,340
TK?

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,535
Oh, I was just wishing
my Digi-Egg would

97
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,320
hurry up and hatch
already so I could grow up!

98
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,700
Don't sweat it, little bro.

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,320
When your Digimon hatches, it'll be the
coolest one yet!

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Exactly!

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Okay, everyone.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,180
Now that we've stuffed our faces,
what are we gonna do next?

103
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
You know what's next.

104
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,640
We have to go to Server to save Jedi from
his enemies.

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,003
Well, according to my
calculations of longitude and

106
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:57,020
latitude, I'd say Server is
quite some distance from here.

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,040
I can't even swim across the bathtub,
let alone an ocean!

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
I'll never make it!

109
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,140
Why do we have to go, anyway?

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,900
What I mean is, Devamon's gone from the
island.

111
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,120
The Black Gears have disappeared,
too!

112
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:12,020
We've been once around the island, so
we pretty much know where everything is.

113
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,320
We wouldn't have to worry about food or
water.

114
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,340
What are you saying?

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
Why should we believe what this weirdo
Jedi guy says?

116
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,500
What I mean is, how do we even know that
this place Server really exists?

117
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,660
What are you thinking?

118
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,280
If we hang around here, guys, we'll never
get back home!

119
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,020
I don't know, guys.

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,480
Devamon almost got us.

121
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,980
Maybe we shouldn't go.

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,000
At least we know what we're up against
over here.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,520
And even if we wanted to go, what mode of
transportation could we utilize?

124
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,140
We don't even know what the fashions are
like on Server.

125
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
Mm-hmm.

126
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,880
Maybe we should stay here a while longer
and think this through.

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,180
What's with you, man?

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's go!

129
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
Huh?

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,820
TK?

131
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,180
We don't know what kind of danger will be
waiting for us, but let's see!

132
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm sure Angemon would say the same thing
if he were still around.

133
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,460
So I'm going!

134
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
We'll go, too!

135
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,420
If we have the tags and crests,
we'll be able to digivolve again, right?

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,980
Once we transform into our new shapes,
we'll be able to protect you for sure!

137
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,080
Utamon!

138
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,080
Sora, so what do you say?

139
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,920
Our chances for success are extremely
high!

140
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,260
Come on, Mimi!

141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,220
I'll bet you we'll be the prettiest
flowers on all of Server!

142
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,340
Don't worry about me!

143
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I'll swim to Server!

144
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Come on!

145
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Let's do it!

146
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
Let's go!

147
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,680
Count me in!

148
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
K, I'll go!

149
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
I'm convinced!

150
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,520
Well, I'm not staying by myself!

151
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
I'll go, too!

152
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,980
All right, it's unanimous!

153
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,220
That's great!

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
It's decided!

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,540
We're going to Server!

156
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Yay!

157
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Peppa Bread!

158
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,280
Peppa Bread!

159
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Blue Blaster!

160
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,580
At our current rate, it'll take us forever
to build a raft!

161
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,020
Don't worry about it, Izzy.

162
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,760
It's not like we're in any kind of hurry.

163
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Huh?

164
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Leomon!

165
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
So I heard you are all going to Server.

166
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
How did you know?

167
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,200
Oh, you know us monsters.

168
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
We all love to gossip.

169
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,160
I thought I'd see if you needed some help
with anything.

170
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,680
You mean you'll really help us?

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,780
I've got some friends who want to help as
well.

172
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
Mmm!

173
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Elok Mon!

174
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,880
Mojomon and Sitarumon, too!

175
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,660
Yeah!

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,380
Hi!

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
What's up?

178
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
Mojomon!

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,600
Fist of the Beast King!

180
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,740
Wow, Leomon!

181
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,190
So

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,520
dynamically designed.

183
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,020
I think I'm getting seasick already.

184
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,340
Get a grip, Joe.

185
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
It'll have to do.

186
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,900
Believe me, that raft is strong enough to
get you across the ocean.

187
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,100
Thanks, Leomon.

188
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,140
We never could have done it without your
help.

189
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Oh!

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
What is it?

191
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Hi!

192
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,440
Get your egg!

193
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
You hatched!

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,000
Boyo!

195
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:24,001
Boyo Mon!

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How cute!

197
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,001
That's great!

198
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
Yay!

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:28,820
Yay!

200
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,680
He did it!

201
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Yay!

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,920
Boyo Mon is a jellyfish-type Digimon of
few words.

203
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,940
But, if his friends are in trouble,
he is ready for action!

204
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,380
This is goodbye.

205
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
And good luck!

206
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,480
Thanks!

207
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Goodbye!

208
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Goodbye!

209
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,660
So we sailed away from File Island,
where we had some really cool adventures.

210
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:03,000
When we had to survive on our own,
we grew up very fast.

211
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,780
Except Joe.

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,240
He just threw up very fast.

213
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,780
But he came around, too.

214
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,978
We don't know what's
waiting for us on the other

215
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,741
side of the ocean, but
we'll face it as a team!

216
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,440
I can't see anything.

217
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
I wonder how much longer this trip will
take.

218
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,200
Chill out, Joe.

219
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,180
We just left.

220
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,260
The salt air is killing my sinuses, and
we've only got enough food for two weeks.

221
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
If we run out of food, we'll catch some
fish.

222
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,080
Well, the one good thing is, this is
beautiful weather for sailing.

223
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,530
So good!

224
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,270
I didn't calculate these waves being so
rough.

225
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,890
Hey, hey!

226
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,950
Boyomon!

227
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,450
What?

228
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,330
Oh!

229
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,930
Oh, Boyomon, be careful!

230
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,850
Look!

231
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,010
Tidal Wave!

232
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,930
That had to be 12 feet tall!

233
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,550
18.3 to be exact!

234
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,930
Was that another boat that caused that
wave?

235
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,930
There's no boat that can do that!

236
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,610
An island!

237
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,280
Waymon is a giant Digimon who lives in the
deep oceans of the digital world.

238
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,440
Its jet arrows are unbelievable!

239
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,800
It was massive!

240
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,841
A Waymon can sometimes be fierce, but
I've never seen one act this aggressive!

241
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,110
I hope we don't give him a sore throat!

242
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,710
Technically, it's not the throat, it's the
esophagus that leads to the stomach!

243
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,390
He thinks we're fast food!

244
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,290
Oh, he really did eat us!

245
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,670
Sooner or later, this has to lead to an
exit!

246
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,410
It does, but you don't want to go there!

247
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,950
This is damaging my hair all the way to
the roots!

248
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,150
Here's my roots?

249
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,290
You're a plant!

250
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,370
What is that gross gooey junk?

251
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,810
Maybe they're anybody's!

252
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,470
They're attacking us because they think
we're germs or something!

253
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,740
Finally, we've stopped!

254
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Is everyone okay?

255
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,420
Where are we?

256
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,860
Anatomically speaking, this would be the
stomach.

257
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,000
The stomach?

258
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,560
Isn't that where food goes after it's
chewed up?

259
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,561
Yeah!

260
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Gastric juice!

261
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,560
What?!

262
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,080
It's the acid in the stomach that
dissolves the food!

263
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
We're melting!

264
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,180
Don't let it get on you!

265
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,960
We better get out of here before we give
him a major ulcer!

266
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,500
Ty, look up there!

267
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,860
It's a black gear!

268
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,880
That's why Waymon was acting so
aggressive!

269
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:49,580
Joe, do something to help!

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,560
Why me?

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,640
Someone can climb on these!

272
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Poison Ivy!

273
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,300
Right!

274
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,620
I'll do it!

275
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,250
Okay, I destroyed it!

276
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,100
Are you okay?

277
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,300
Yeah... Somehow
we got out of there!

278
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah... Waymon, talk to me!

279
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
You're okay!

280
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,700
Again!

281
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,220
Sorry about that!

282
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,600
I must have had a tummy ache or something!

283
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,300
It's okay!

284
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,900
We all know it wasn't your fault!

285
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,700
That's right!

286
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,200
It was the black gear inside you!

287
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,480
Those black gears are rude!

288
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,780
I'll bet that's the last one!

289
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
I bet you're wrong!

290
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,960
Thanks, kids!

291
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I owe you one!

292
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,020
Don't mention it, Waymon!

293
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
It was our pleasure!

294
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,380
By the way, do you know how far it is to
serve her?

295
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,100
Yes, it would take me five days!

296
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,480
Make that three and a half without
traffic!

297
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,360
Great!

298
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,740
Our raft's broken!

299
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
Are you going to serve her?

300
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,600
Yeah, we were trying to!

301
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll take you there myself!

302
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,440
It's not every day your lunch saves your
life!

303
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Really?

304
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,740
Yay!

305
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
All right!

306
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
There!

307
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,280
This is great!

308
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,820
This sure is a whole lot faster and
smoother than that raft!

309
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,760
Which means I won't get seasick!

310
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,154
Now if we only knew
where we could find those

311
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:53,480
tags and those crests that
Devamon hid somewhere!

312
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:55,420
Did you say Devamon?

313
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,760
Yeah, do you know him?

314
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,840
Well, I don't know anything about tags or
crests.

315
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,800
But a while ago, Devamon hid something
deep at the bottom of the ocean.

316
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,260
Can you tell us where?

317
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,740
It's on the way to server.

318
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,460
You can all ride inside me and I'll take
you there.

319
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,200
But no tickling!

320
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,890
I'm so out of shape, I have to rest here
for a while.

321
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,370
I gotta drop a couple of thousand pounds.

322
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,730
Thanks, Waymon!

323
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,710
What's that?

324
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,630
A convenience store.

325
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,690
Huh?

326
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,910
What is it?

327
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,250
Jumajumaj!

328
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,710
Jumajumaj lives deep inside the earth
drilling tunnels.

329
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,030
He uses his iron drill spin and crusher
bone to wipe out his enemies.

330
00:16:59,370 --> 00:16:59,850
Oh!

331
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,070
A black gear!

332
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,710
I knew that couldn't have been the last
black gear.

333
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,270
It is Lord Devamon's will that no one
shall pass!

334
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,490
Ty, leave this to us Digimon.

335
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,010
You try to find the tags.

336
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,210
I got it!

337
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,330
Ty, you think that drill scares us?

338
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,970
Think again!

339
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,190
Digimon!

340
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,190
Digimon!

341
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,330
Now's our chance!

342
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,230
Come

343
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,690
on, you've got him down!

344
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,330
Get him!

345
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,730
Heartful torpedo!

346
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
I think it's time I join the battle!

347
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
Digimon!

348
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,590
Digimon Digiball 2!

349
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Yeah!

350
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,480
Crusher Bull!

351
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,420
Kabuterimon, aim for the black gear!

352
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,920
Electro Shocker!

353
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Yeah!

354
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,930
Electro Shocker!

355
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,420
Can't stay in this store!

356
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,940
What's in the box?

357
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,860
Please forgive me for attacking you.

358
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,680
Pardon me, do you know where the tags are?

359
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,140
The tags should be in the convenience
store, next to the jerky.

360
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,980
The tags!

361
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,660
Just like the ones Jedi showed us during

362
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
How pretty!

363
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,560
Remember what Jedi told us, you guys.

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,160
The crests are scattered throughout the
continent of Server.

365
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,440
And if we get both the tags and the crests,
we'll all be able to digivolve once again.

366
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,340

find the crests!

It's a輕ersis!
