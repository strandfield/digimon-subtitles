00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,848
After being transported
back to the digital world,


00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,420
things were obviously
different and most disturbing.


00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,900
Chumon told us of how he and Sukumon were
separated, and how the Dark Masters now


00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:13,340
rule the entire world from the newly
created Spiral Mountain.


00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,700
These Mega Digimon were most evil,
and prove that fact on little Chumon.


00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,126
It seems eight Champion
Digimon can't even beat one Mega,


00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:23,680
so we made a break for it
with the help of Pixiemon.


00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,320
He created a diversion so we could get
away.


00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,940
What a brave little guy.


00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,560
Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:56,600
Change into Digital Champions to save the
Digital World!


00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,560
Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,540
Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
Digimon,


00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,540
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,460
Digimon, Digital Monsters...


00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,300
You're as ready as you'll ever be!


00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Go get him!


00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,340
I think that was meant to be encouraging.


00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,040
He has an awful lot of confidence in us.


00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,196
You may have fooled
those silly children with


00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:44,581
this brave act, but we
know that they don't win!


00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,000
What makes you think it's just an act?


00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,540
Oh, it doesn't seem right just leaving him
there.


00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,220
Remember, he wanted it this way.


00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,980
Look, the fog's finally clearing.


00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,080
Great.


00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,140
Now he can clearly see that we're lost.


00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,920
It's more productive to think of ourselves
as on our way, Joe.


00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,060
Yeah, I feel better already.


00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,180
All I know is I'm getting pretty hungry,
and I'm getting cold.


00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,840
But everybody's okay, right?


00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Besides being hungry and cold and lost.


00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,020
Don't forget, frightened, tired,
and upset about Pixie Mom.


00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,140
Otherwise, we're fine.


00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,900
I have a feeling we've been here before.


00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,880
Wait a minute, look!


00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,660
What?


00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,380
Here, huh?


00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,540
Those smashed-up foam boots!


00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Ah!


00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,040
You don't think that they could be the
same ones, do you?


00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Of course!


00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,420
I can't believe it.


00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,000
This whole time, we thought we were making
all this progress, but now it looks like


00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,980
we've just been traveling in one big
circle.


00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,360
How small they look from here,
like ants.


00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,180
Strange that such little creatures could
cause so much trouble.


00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,140
They won't for long.


00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,280
They're standing on the edge of my
territory now, the sea.


00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,300
I'll be the one to finish these
digi-destined once and for all.


00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,380
Hmm, bold words.


00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,180
But you're not the first to make such a
boast, Metal Seadromoth.


00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:09,980
But I will be the last.


00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,600
There'll be shark made before the day is
through.


00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,440
So we've just gone around in one big
circle, huh?


00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,040
Makes the whole thing seem kind of
pointless, doesn't it?


00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
Hold on, maybe that's it.


00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,060
Maybe the pointlessness of it is the whole
point.


00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,500
Say what?


00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Thanks for the philosophy, that's a big
help.


00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Help!


00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,760
Please!


00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,200
Look, out there, someone's drowning!


00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,460
Somebody's gotta do something!


00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,640
They're too tired, they'll be drowned
themselves.


00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,940
Okay, then in that case, we'll have to go!


00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,580
Kari!


00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Whoa, wait up, TK.


00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,240
Maybe someone bigger should go.


00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
We can use that out, Rinner.


00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm coming too!


00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,680
Me too!


00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,460
Okay, okay, let's go!


00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,640
Hey, wait up, I'm coming too!


00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
I can help!


00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Help me!


00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Help!


00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Stroke!


00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,600
Stroke!


00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,440
Stroke!


00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Stroke!


00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Stroke!


00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,340
You can say that again.


00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
That's Shelmont, and he's not here to play
water polo.


00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,380
Paddle like crazy!


00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,000
There's no escaping, you're in my element
now!


00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,500
Come on guys, move it!


00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,200
Stroke!


00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,540
Stroke!


00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:22,820
Stroke!


00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,300
Stroke!


00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:23,340
Stroke!


00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:23,420
Stroke!


00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:23,860
Stroke!


00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:23,960
Stroke!


00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,240
Stroke!


00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
Right on top of us!


00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Watch out!


00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,520
Paddling or am I just talking to myself?


00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,980
We may be exhausted, but we can't just sit
here, we've gotta help!


00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,780
Oh!


00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,400
Oh!


00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,620
Move it to us, you save your
Digi-strength!


00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Digimon!


00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
We


00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,070
are the champions!


00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,590
Digimon!


00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,760
Digimon!


00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,520
Digimon!


00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,521
Digimon!


00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
What's going on?


00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,040
Here's my spiral twitch!


00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
Cooper Shocker!


00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Come on, Marching Fishes!


00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,200
Whoa, that's more like it!


00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
This is the way to travel!


00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Oh, crap!


00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Perfect goodness!


00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,520
I know they're all dead tired,
and they may not feel like it at the


00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:56,500
moment, but I think today proved that our
Digimon are getting stronger and stronger!


00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,340
That'd be great, but what makes you think
so?


00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,060
I remember the last time we took on
Shellmon.


00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,740
Agumon had to digivolve into Greymon
before we could finally beat him.


00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,461
And even then
it was close... ...


00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
But this time they beat him easily,
without Greymon.


00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Yeah, but don't forget, Ty, they ganged up
on him!


00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,640
It was four of them against one!


00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,940
But they didn't have to digivolve as far
to do it.


00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I still say it means you're stronger than
you were.


00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,640
Or maybe Shellmon's just weaker than he
was.


00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,180
How come everyone's being such a downer
all of a sudden?


00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm trying to be positive here.


00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,299
Besides, I still can't
get out of my mind


00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,360
something that Pixiemon
said to me back there.


00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,120
But you said it was possible to save the
planet if the eight of us were all together.


00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,660
How come it's not happening?


00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,900
What's up, Pixiemon?


00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,860
The truth is, being together's not enough.


00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
There's something else that you need to do
to beat them.


00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,140
I think he meant we had to get stronger,
and that's just what's happening.


00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
Yeah, maybe Tai's right.


00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,500
I feel stronger!


00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,456
Come to think of it, you are looking kind
of buff.


00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,260
Thanks very much.


00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,440
That's a compliment, right?


00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,220
Do I look stronger to you, Izzy?


00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,300
I don't know.


00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,920
Make a muscle.


00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,640
I was!


00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,360
Do I look different, TK?


00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,640
Yeah, you look buffed out to the max.


00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,020
Sorry.


00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,676
Well, to be honest, you don't look any
different to me.


00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,780
But give it time, Gottoman.


00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,020
You'll catch up with the rest.


00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,240
If you say so.


00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,720
Come to think of it, your coat's looking
glossier.


00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,140
Really, you think?


00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
Did it get brighter all of a sudden?


00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,880
Or is it just Tai's sunny disposition?


00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Maybe it's like a mirage.


00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,700
Was that Shack there before?


00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,900
Maybe somebody moved in when we were gone.


00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,220
Mmm, something smells suspiciously like
food.


00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,220
Let's take it easy, everyone.


00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,600
Remember, we're in the digi-world where
not everything is what it appears to be.


00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,840
Looks may be deceiving, but smells,
that's something else.


00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,360
And I definitely smell grilling
hamburgers.


00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,880
See?


00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,360
It's a snack bar!


00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,760
Burgers, sodas, ice cream, pizza!


00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:09,761
Huh?


00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
Mirage or not, I'll take my chances.


00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Gangway!


00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,230
Sorry, Mimi.


00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,970
Oh, dang.


00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,426
Come on, what are you two waiting for?


00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,371
Yeah, they're going to eat everything
without us!


00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:34,610
Huh?


00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,850
Ugh!


00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Snack time!


00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,000
It's Scorpio Mon, one of Metal Seedermon's
flunkies.


00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
Between his pinches and his tail, it's
hard to know which end of him is worth!


00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,380
Sorry, but the only munchies around here
are you.


00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,240
Now say good-bye, it's bedtime!


00:08:59,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah?


00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,480
Yeah!


00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,260
Scorpion, score!


00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,780
Can't breathe!


00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Can't!


00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,330
Those sounds never mean anything good!


00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,470
Let's go!


00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,750
Oh, no!


00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,930
Something tells me this means no chili
dogs!


00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,330
Huh?


00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,890
Huh?


00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,190
Shh!


00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,740
What's happened to them?


00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,120
Aren't they... could they be?


00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Ah!


00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Shh!


00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,560
Well done, Scorpio Mon.


00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,880
These Digi-Testin are not so difficult to
handle after all.


00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,400
Here's your reward.


00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,180
Oh, clams!


00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,980
Thank you, thank you, boss!


00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,420
I just love clams!


00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
I just can't get enough of them!


00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Shh!


00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,320
What was that?


00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
What is it, boss?


00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,280
You want some?


00:09:59,480 --> 00:09:59,960
Quiet!


00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,580
I thought I heard something.


00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,240
I didn't hear anything.


00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,180
Well, now to finish them off.


00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,400
Eight little gnats and their Digimon
accomplices.


00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Hmm?


00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,060
What's this?


00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,120
There's supposed to be eight of them!


00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,540
Two of them are missing!


00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,800
You chuckle-headed cockle-shell!


00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,200
Stop eating and find the other two now!


00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,780
Oh, you got it!


00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,420
Right away!


00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,140
I'm on it!


00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Whoa!


00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Come back here!


00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,540
I hate it when they do this!


00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,280
Hey!


00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Slow down!


00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Too


00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,330
many clams for lunch!


00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm not built for this!


00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,880
This way!


00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
This way!


00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,420
Oh, forget it!


00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,200
I can't run anymore!


00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,300
We'll just have to stand and fight!


00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Right!


00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,120
Huh?


00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,180
We may not have to!


00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
What happened?


00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,940
I don't know, but he's gone!


00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,980
Ha-ha!


00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,600
What a lucky break!


00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,620
Lucky for us, he doesn't work out!


00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,180
Oh!


00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm getting my exercise right now!


00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,340
My roots are exhausted!


00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
And I am so hungry, I could just about eat
seaweed!


00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,080
Hey, wait!


00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
Look it!


00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Nothing!


00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,040
Get your myths off my class!


00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Huh?


00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,860
Get your myths off my classes!


00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,480
Digimon!


00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Digimon!


00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:52,940
Digimon!


00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:53,080
Digimon!


00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,500
Anirosu Qu honorable comeが�られよ!


00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
Digimon!


00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,100
Digimon!


00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:57,580
Oh, cow monstu!


00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh, cow monstu!


00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:07,280
How much digimon too-Dozomon!


00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,730
Decarcuma!


00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,950
Oh, yeah?


00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,450
How about some needle spray?


00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,690
Ha!


00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,130
Harpoon torpedoes!


00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,979
If the Digimon really
are getting stronger, they


00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,090
should be able to handle
Scorpiomon, no problem.


00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,850
I hope so, but it doesn't really look like
they're doing too well.


00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,390
Whoa!


00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,810
Hey, put me down, you overgrown crawdaddy,
before I get really angry!


00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,870
Oh, boy.


00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,710
Why don't you come out from behind your
shell and fight like clams?


00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,810
Ah, Mimi, cool it.


00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,546
I don't think he thought that was very
funny.


00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,570
Scorpion storm!


00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,730
Run!


00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,350
Hey, squid breath!


00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,570
We're the ones you want!


00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,770
Tail blade!


00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,190
Ooh!


00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:03,670
I just love clams!


00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:04,830
Hurry up!


00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,710
Now's your chance!


00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,590
Get moving, Digimon!


00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,230
Digimon!


00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,250
Digimon!


00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,730
Digimon!


00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:20,910
Top of my Digimon!


00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Digimon!


00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,320
Digimon!


00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,321
Digimon!


00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,130
Monster!


00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,610
Gauri...


00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,790
Where is that fool with those other
children?


00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,890
I'm tired of waiting.


00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:42,810
Hurry!


00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,570
Faster!


00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,070
We gotta move, now!


00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,370
Did you really have to bring along the
souvenir?


00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,890
That does it.


00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,010
I'll worry about the other two children
later.


00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,810
Yikes!


00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,790
And I thought Shailmon's breath was
gnarly!


00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,630
He'll toast him like marshmallows!


00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,650
This way!


00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,110
Hurry!


00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,090
Hey, guys!


00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,370
Nap time's over!


00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,110
Ty, you've got to get out of here!


00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,850
Sora, get up!


00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,510
Matt!


00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,050
Izzy!


00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,630
Move!


00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,730
Or you're gonna be toast!


00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,770
I mean literally!


00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,990
Everybody on your feet!


00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,430
Hurry!


00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:12,890
Wh-what's going on?


00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,070
Yaaaaay!


00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,910
Keep moving!


00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,930
We're almost there!


00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,090
Hurry up!


00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,190
Let's get out of here!


00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,350
Ha!


00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,070
Farewell, Digi-Destin.


00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,370
It was a rare pleasure knowing you.


00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,870
Medium rare!


00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:36,871
Yeah!


00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,670
Oh!


00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,010
Who's the hot tempered foul mouth who...


00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Scorpio Mon!


00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,200
How did this happen?


00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
Uh, well, you see, that's a fair question.


00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,620
You see, it happened... Silence!


00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,260
You failed me and I will not forgive
failure!


00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,340
No, I didn't think that you were!


00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
That


00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,430
was a close one.


00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,630
But we came out of it okay.


00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,830
That's what counts.


00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,250
I hate to tell you this, everything's not
okay.


00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,170
Huh?


00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,050
Mimi's right.


00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,630
What are you guys talking about?


00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,510
Did I miss something?


00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,550
The Digimon still may not be strong
enough.


00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,590
Both of ours had to digivolve again before
they could beat Scorpio Mon.


00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,050
And he was just a flunky.


00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,593
Frankly, it's hard to see
how they stand a chance


00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,230
against a fully digivolve
monster like Metal Seedra Mon.


00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,570
You could be right.


00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,770
Maybe Pixie Mon meant something else when
he said we were missing something.


00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,810
Whatever the secret is, we've got to find
it if we ever hope to save the world.


00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,550
Yes, and the sooner the better!


00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,450
It's the little Seedra Mon again!


00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Yoo-hoo!


00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
You think I...


00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,040
Have you seen us?


00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,890
Pathetic little fools!


00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,130
You think you can escape me by sea?


00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,090
I think it's safe to say he's seen us!


00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,330
Oh, faster, sooner Mon, we need speed!


00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,430
Yeah, stop dog paddling!


00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:42,970
Ha-ha!


00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,910
Tonight you sleep with the fishes!


00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,772
And as for you.


00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:05,110
..


00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,130
Uh-oh.


00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,550
Is he gone?


00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,350
I don't think so.


00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,350
I can't stand this waiting.


00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,170
I bet he's right below us.


00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:14,390
Shh!


00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,570
Knock it off!


00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ooh!


00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,970
Dranny!


00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,250
Yeah!


00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,660
Never send a rookie to do Omega's work!


00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,761
Stuck in the middle of the ocean, the
Digi-destined are at Metal Seedra Mon's mercy.


00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,380
What will happen on the next Digimon
Digital Monsters?


00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,380
Let's go!


00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,980
Let's go!
