1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
After we landed in the forest,
Palmon and I crossed over to another

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:05,940
floating island, where we found Izzy and
Tentamon.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,860
While Izzy was busy doing something or
other with his computer, Centauromon,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,060
with a black gear stuck in him,
attacked!

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,808
Izzy somehow started
talking to me through

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,200
my digivice and led
Tentamon and I to safety.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
Well, almost.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,620
Our little partners digivolved just in
time, driving out the black gear.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,960
Leomon, who was still under Devimon's evil
control, appeared.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,620
But Izzy and I used our digivices and
chewed that bad kitty away.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,520
Digimon, digital monsters, digimon are the
champions!

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:59,040
Change into Digital Champions,
to save the digital world!

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,120
Digimon, digital monsters, digimon are the
champions!

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,600
Digimon!

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,840
Digital Monsters!

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,260
Digimon are the champions!

17
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,630
I, Devimon had completely separated those
seven brats and their pesty Digimon!

18
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:40,670
That is, until that Tai and Mimi caught up
with Matt and Izzy.

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,790
But I'll make sure they never find their
other friends.

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,493
Especially with the
plans I have for Sora and

21
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:49,591
Joe on that lovely day,
the Bakuman Holiday.

22
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,810
There's one thing I've learned in
DigiWorld.

23
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,590
Beds don't make good boats.

24
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,230
Did I just hear you eating again?

25
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,210
Uh-huh.

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,170
Didn't I tell you not to eat all the food
since we don't know when we'll find land?

27
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,150
I told you that we'd need to ration,
which means to save food for later,

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,410
as in much later.

29
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,150
But it is later, Joe.

30
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,890
You told me that 20 minutes ago.

31
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,270
20 minutes is not much later.

32
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,546
Please tell me that there is still some
food in the bag.

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:33,970
Well, no.

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,869
Since you can't handle
eating and floating

35
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,710
on the ocean at the
same time, I ate it all.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,030
Besides, I need food to digivolve in case
we run into bad Digimon.

37
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:42,590
So, have we seen any bad Digimon?

38
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,010
No!

39
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,810
If I starve, who are you gonna protect?

40
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,290
That's enough about food.

41
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,870
Things will get better soon.

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,090
Hang in there, buddy.

43
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,390
That crate is gonna hit us!

44
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,690
Maybe it's full of fruit, vegetables,
bread, milk, cereal, hot dogs,

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,930
cookies, candy, soda!

46
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,910
I wish!

47
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,590
You wish!

48
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,770
We wouldn't need more food if you hadn't
eaten ours!

49
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,190
You're strong when you're hungry.

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,830
Starvation is a good motivator.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,910
Looks like I'll need a jackhammer to open
this.

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,610
Hmm.

53
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,950
Let's see.

54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,270
Um...

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,800
Come on!

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,420
Right, you little digi-pest!

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Pummelwhack!

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,460
Come out of the sea, marching fishes!

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,280
I'm not scared of some sickin' fish!

60
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:56,281
There!

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,220
One second thought that really hurt!

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,425
What powerful force could
cause this evil digimon to be

63
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,080
driven back and out-muscled
by a bunch of small fish?

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,820
When the small and meek join forces to
fight for a good purpose, they can often

65
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:10,040
bring about the downfall of the big and
powerful.

66
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,041
Yeah!

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Get off me!

68
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,710
Then again, sometimes they haven't got a
chance.

69
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,950
And neither do we!

70
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,050
And now for you meeks!

71
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,020
Gumbamon, hitchy-miles too!

72
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,480
Hey, cuckoo-miles!

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,680
You're bigger now.

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm so scared.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
Not.

76
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,540
Here's some hand-to-hand.

77
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,780
Come a-whack it.

78
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,640
Harpoon torpedo!

79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,600
Yo!

80
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
You've got to climb up on my back!

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Cowards!

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,760
Go ahead and run!

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,620
See how far you get!

84
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,780
Pretty cats, come back and fight!

85
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
I dare ya!

86
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,460
Come on!

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,580
Oh, man.

88
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
I don't like adventure.

89
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,220
I'm a stay-at-home-and-read kind of guy.

90
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Huh?

91
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm tired, hungry, sinking.

92
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Sinking is bad.

93
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,900
Ikakuman, hey, wait a minute.

94
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,700
I thought you were supposed to be some
sort of super water mammal.

95
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
Whoa!

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Gah!

97
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Catch anything?

98
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,840
Not yet.

99
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,580
Give me time.

100
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,096
I'm hoping to catch something big.

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,620
I'd even be happy if you caught me a
little sardine.

102
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,640
I know how hungry you can get.

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,560
If I caught a huge any kind of fish,
you'd be right there eating it with me.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,180
Right?

105
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,060
Well, since you put it that way... Do
you really think you can make a big catch?

106
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,140
Oh, look!

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,420
Maybe there's one now!

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,780
Oh, boy!

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
It feels like a whale!

110
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,500
This is a whopper for sure!

111
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,240
Pull harder!

112
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm trying to!

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,580
Let me help!

114
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
Help!

115
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,320
Oh, my!

116
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,160
That's a person!

117
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Joe!

118
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,560
Then a large crate drifted over to us.

119
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,800
Ogurran popped out and attacked us.

120
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,100
Goodness.

121
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
How horrible.

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,260
It was, but I did evolve and we escaped
him.

123
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,860
But then my strength left me.

124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,640
I just couldn't seem to keep my energy up.

125
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,880
The next thing I knew, I was sinking
deeper and deeper.

126
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,780
And when I opened my eyes and looked
around, I finally spotted Joe nearby.

127
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:24,640
He was unconscious at the time and sinking
fast.

128
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,760
I tried to get him to the surface,
but my strength was giving out again and I

129
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,800
knew I couldn't hold my breath much
longer.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,560
And that's about the time your fishing
line hit me.

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,461
So I grabbed that line and wrapped it around
Joe and hung on until you pulled us in.

132
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,180
Oh, my goodness!

133
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,860
I'm so glad that the both of you are okay.

134
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,940
But I'm worried about Joe.

135
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
You are?

136
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,320
Joe's going to be just fine, Gomamon.

137
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, yes, physically, but I'm worried
about his confidence.

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,480
Fighting Ogremon back there really knocked
him out.

139
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,380
He needs to rebuild his self-confidence.

140
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,080
How can we help him?

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,480
Very simple.

142
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,800
We just make him our leader.

143
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,100
Huh?

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Oh!

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,040
Hey!

146
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,380
Where's Ogremon?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,480
Huh?

148
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,160
Huh?

149
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,680
Huh?

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,460
He's gone!

151
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,780
But we've got a bigger problem.

152
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
We can't find the others.

153
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,700
What should we do?

154
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,860
We're stuck on this deserted island with
no leader.

155
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:22,300
So I guess you're going to have to lead
us, Joe.

156
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,180
What?

157
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,220
I'm Forim!

158
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
And me!

159
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,900
Not me!

160
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
I am not a leader!

161
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
You have to!

162
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,100
You're the strongest one here!

163
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,760
Not to mention the bravest!

164
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,700
Come on, Joe!

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,580
Remember how you fought the Unamon?

166
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I am brave!

167
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,540
You're right!

168
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,060
I am the brightest one here!

169
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:46,420
Well, let's not get too carried away.

170
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Oh.

171
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,280
But if I fail, who will save you or me?

172
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,740
My fish line?

173
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Huh?

174
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,420
Did you hear anything?

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,420
Yeah, it seemed to come from up there.

176
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,400
What do you suppose it is?

177
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,200
Looks kinda like a church.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Wherever there's a church, there's usually
people!

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
Maybe our friends!

180
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,400
Someone should check it out.

181
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,140
I'll go!

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,000
Wait, Biomon!

183
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,380
Huh?

184
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,680
Joe's our leader now!

185
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,020
What?

186
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,420
Well, lead us!

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,340
What if we see a bad Digimon?

188
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,120
I, uh... I need a moment.

189
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,540
Okay.

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,620
Two, three, four...
Oh, you're left!

191
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,520
Two, three, four...
Oh, you're left!

192
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,380
Two, three, four... You're left!

193
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,460
Two, three... Must he keep
up that army march drivel?

194
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
Halt!

195
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Notice anything?

196
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,920
It all looks sort of familiar to me.

197
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,700
As if it's a place I've dreamed about,
or deja vu.

198
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,760
You know, like we've been here before.

199
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,840
You're right.

200
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,300
This definitely looks like the part of the
island that broke away.

201
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Yeah.

202
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,380
Yep!

203
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,809
So, we should find
everyone else, or at least

204
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:52,960
some other people,
taking shelter in that church!

205
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,680
You're assuming quite a bit there.

206
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,780
Fine!

207
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
That's my opinion!

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm just giving you another view.

209
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,780
I'm the leader here!

210
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,400
Okay, excuse me.

211
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,640
Let's move out!

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Wow!

213
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,960
We've created a monster.

214
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,140
Hey, you think a black ear got him?

215
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
Go Maman!

216
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,600
Okay, step lively now, troops.

217
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,160
Let's have no stragglers.

218
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Here's the church.

219
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,220
Who's going in?

220
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,880
What are you waiting for?

221
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Huh?

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,680
What's wrong?

223
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Well, boss?

224
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,900
Joe, you're the leader.

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,740
Do you want me to take a peek?

226
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,860
No, I don't want you taking a peek.

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,540
I can't wait to go in there!

228
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,640
I think it worked.

229
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,280
Okay.

230
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm afraid.

231
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
I was right.

232
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,780
Just a normal group of people.

233
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Oh, hey guys!

234
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,640
There are people in the church dancing
badly, I might add.

235
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,160
Huh?

236
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Huh?

237
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,800
There are people.

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,700
They're dancing and they're wearing masks
like it's Halloween.

239
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,500
Hall-o-what?

240
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,180
They're celebrating the Bakuman holiday.

241
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,020
It reminds me of Halloween.

242
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,380
We'd love to have you join us.

243
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,620
We don't have a lot of young people
around.

244
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,700
And no holiday is complete without them.

245
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,400
You arrive just in time for some fun.

246
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,460
Like trick or treat?

247
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,940
You do that for Bakuman?

248
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Yes.

249
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Wait, Bakuman?

250
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
As in Lord Bakuman?

251
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,100
Yes.

252
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,431
But the only Bakuman
I know of is a horrible

253
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:44,701
Digimon who lives
among ghosts as their ruler.

254
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,040
Why would you honor and celebrate someone
like that in the words of our friends?

255
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,160
He's like a loser.

256
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,820
You got that right.

257
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,660
Don't you dare come in here telling us who
to honor or not.

258
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,220
Now, now.

259
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,880
Back off.

260
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,620
You're a little touchy.

261
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,120
We just want to know when the trick or
treating starts.

262
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,680
You're not afraid?

263
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
No.

264
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,020
Well, you should be because it's a trick.

265
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,580
Huh?

266
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:11,581
Huh?

267
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,980
And you're the treat!

268
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,080
The masked man was the evil Digimon Lord
Bakuman in disguise.

269
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,620
No one had ever seen him in his true form.

270
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,020
Bakuman?

271
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,820
It is Bakuman!

272
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,740
Trick or treat!

273
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,120
Trick or treat!

274
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,950
The dancers!

275
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,030
Who I bet are ghosts too!

276
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,590
That's mine!

277
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:44,591
Oh!

278
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,530
Oh!

279
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,870
Zoro's lister!

280
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,270
Oh!

281
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,210
Gomaman!

282
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,430
Digivolve too!

283
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,170
Gomaman!

284
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,070
I need food, you were right.

285
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,430
I shoulda saved some earlier.

286
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:02,790
Bayamon!

287
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,030
Digivolve!

288
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,310
I'm hungry too!

289
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,870
Can't Digivolve!

290
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,130
Let me go!

291
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,030
Oh, I'm allergic!

292
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,370
Ow, allergic to pain!

293
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,350
Get out of there!

294
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,430
Guilty!

295
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,450
It's my dream!

296
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,330
You're in a dream!

297
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,910
Okay, don't panic.

298
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,830
I'm still in control and feeling strong.

299
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,050
Okay.

300
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,350
I don't want to be somebody's appetizer!

301
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,330
I'm supposed to go to med school!

302
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,030
And pepper!

303
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:43,950
More!

304
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,330
Why not?

305
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,010
Salt and pepper?

306
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,950
You're not really gonna eat us,
are you?

307
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,376
You're a little on the
scrawny side, but you'd

308
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:55,950
be surprised what the
right seasonings can do!

309
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,490
You think we can finagle him into dining
on someone a bit bigger?

310
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,730
What kind of fiend is this guy?

311
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,790
We're just kids!

312
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,690
There must be a way out of here.

313
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,630
Maybe we've been looking in all the wrong
places.

314
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,410
There's not much room to look in this
place.

315
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,710
Hey!

316
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,210
What?

317
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,070
We may be able to trick the guard and
escape.

318
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,310
We may be able to trick him?

319
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,410
I think that's a given.

320
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,550
He doesn't look too smart.

321
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,390
Right, so first we have to try and wake
him up.

322
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,210
How are we gonna do that?

323
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,070
Look at him!

324
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,230
For a ghost, he sleeps like a log.

325
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,850
We just have to get his attention or we'll
never escape.

326
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,430
Uh-huh.

327
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,750
But I'm all out of ideas.

328
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,050
I think I have just the thing.

329
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,470
Hey!

330
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,510
What's the idea?

331
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,050
So when do you start?

332
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,890
Start what?

333
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,230
Start taunting us, you floating bag of
wind.

334
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:49,850
What?

335
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,070
You give bad Digimon a bad name.

336
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:55,090
But I haven't learned how to taunt anyone
yet.

337
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,910
It's easy!

338
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,190
You just find out what we want,
then don't let us have it!

339
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,730
Huh?

340
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,970
Here's how you taunt.

341
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,650
We're starving and want to eat, so
you show us food, but don't give it to us.

342
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,070
Got it?

343
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,750
I think I gotcha!

344
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,770
You know, I got a bunch of bananas.

345
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,890
Then taunt us with them, come on!

346
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,530
Okay.

347
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,270
How's this?

348
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,870
Looks good, doesn't it?

349
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:17,871
I can't see.

350
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,650
Come a little closer.

351
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,810
Huh?

352
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,370
Uh, here?

353
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,130
You have to come even closer to taunt us.

354
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,230
We can't really see ya.

355
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,830
You bet.

356
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,310
See?

357
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh!

358
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,990
Oh, my gosh!

359
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,650
That was a pretty good idea.

360
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,830
Never get between a Digimon and his meal!

361
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,970
You don't want to eat me.

362
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,250
I mostly gristle anyway.

363
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,550
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,110
Are you saying they should eat me first?

365
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,370
Oh, can't you see?

366
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,610
It's curtains for both of us.

367
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,550
Oh, go have your pity party somewhere
else!

368
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,650
Lunching you both will be a treat!

369
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,170
We're scary ghosts!

370
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,730
We like to boo!

371
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,890
Now it's time to chew on you!

372
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,170
Now it's time to chew on you!

373
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:09,171
What will be with her??

374
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,330
We were scared.

375
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,690
Whoa!

376
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Mikakuma!

377
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,740
While we get out of here!

378
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,950
Phone torpedo!

379
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,900
Meteor wing!

380
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Whoa!

381
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,620
He's sure putting up a good fight.

382
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,660
Lord Bakuman is tough.

383
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,100
His power comes from evil, but I know that
good can beat him with time.

384
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,460
Oh, what if it's too late?

385
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,326
It's never too late to
fight evil, but we have to

386
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,741
weaken Lord Bakuman
to help our friends prevail.

387
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,160
We?

388
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,560
You're the leader, not me.

389
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,720
Don't be a quitter!

390
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,720
So what makes you think that we can beat
him?

391
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,080
I once saw a show about this Roman
physicist.

392
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,800
He believed that repeating a phrase helps
you focus mind over matter.

393
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,320
Let's focus on running.

394
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,260
No, we focus on making Bakuman lose his
power.

395
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,960
Okay, you're in charge.

396
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Start focusing.

397
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Bakuman lose your power.

398
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,100
Bakuman lose your power.

399
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,540
Bakuman lose your power.

400
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,040
Bakuman lose your power.

401
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,800
You can jump in any time now.

402
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:33,801
Well, help!

403
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,020
Right, but I don't know.

404
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,421
That is, I just didn't... Uh...

405
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,820
Oh... Well... Good.

406
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,420
Yeah, we'll use my lucky hat.

407
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Bakuman lose your power.

408
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Bakuman lose your power.

409
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,900
Bakuman lose your power.

410
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,080
Bakuman lose your power.

411
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,280
Bakuman lose your power.

412
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,920
Bakuman lose your power.

413
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:02,000
Bakuman lose your power.

414
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
It's your win!

415
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
Take a hit!

416
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Hit the highway!

417
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
We gotcha!

418
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
Way to go, guys!

419
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
You got Pokemon!

420
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
It's an earthquake!

421
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,080
But we're not shaking!

422
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
Uh-oh, those are Black Gears!

423
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,700
Lots of them, huh?

424
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,020
Ow, we're shaking!

425
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,080
Wow, I'm sure glad those Black Gears
broke.

426
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,960
And I'm glad Bakuman's gone.

427
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,740
Look, it's Infinity Mountain.

428
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,040
And that's where we're going.

429
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Yeah.

430
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,760
Maybe our friends are there, Sora.

431
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,160
I hope so.
