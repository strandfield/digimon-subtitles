1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
We got away from Edamon, but not for long.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,800
I wanted us to be ready, and knowing the
crest and tags could create a digivolve,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,740
I tried to give as much energy to Agumon
as he could take.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,340
But things didn't go so well.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,140
Edamon attacked us with an evil Greymon,
and when my guy tried to fight,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,800
he was just too full of food.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,260
That's when I made a mistake.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,160
I forced him to digivolve again.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,660
He turned into Skull Greymon and defeated
the evil Greymon, but then he turned on us.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,820
Thankfully, he ran out of energy and
returned to a Coromon state.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,300
I'll never do that again.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,840
DIGIMON!

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,040
DIGITAL MONSTERS!

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,740
DIGIMON ARE THE CHEMPIONS!

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
DIGIMON!

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
DIGITAL MONSTERS!

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,900
DIGIMON ARE THE CHEMPIONS!

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:59,060
Change into Digital Champions to save the
digital world.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
DIGIMON!

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,720
DIGITAL MONSTERS!

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,380
DIGIMON ARE THE CHEMPIONS!

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,680
DIGIMON!

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,900
DIGITAL MONSTERS!

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,560
DIGIMON ARE THE CHEMPIONS!

25
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,190
Starlet champions.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,330
Digimon.

27
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,690
Digital monsters.

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,520
Okay, so I may have made a slight mistake,
and who hasn't?

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,120
But that techno-doofus Edemon nailed us
big time with that other Greymon.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,881
Our Greymon used up so much energy fighting
him, he digivolved back into Coromon.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,740
Man, this desert is so hot, even a lizard
would need sunscreen.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,800
Zora, can you carry me?

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,600
Not even... A crew cut would
look nice on you, and it's cooler.

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,440
Do I look fat?

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,080
No, you look hot, especially with a fur
coat.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,700
That thing really needs a zipper.

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,420
Or maybe just removable shirt sleeves.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
Hey, how about resting our feet?

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,220
There's no place to sit except on a
cactus.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,620
Great view up here!

41
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,040
Next time I ride.

42
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,020
You look terrible, Coromon.

43
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,060
If only I hadn't acted like such a
bonehead, you never would have digivolved.

44
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,245
Don't be so hard on yourself,
although come to think of

45
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:20,760
it, you really have made a
super icky mess of things.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Thanks, Mimi.

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,760
Oh, don't mention it, Ty.

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,900
I'm glad to help with the pep talk now and
then.

49
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,240
I haven't sweated this much since
cheerleader tryouts.

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Ah!

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
Coromon doesn't look so good.

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,120
I'm worried.

54
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,820
You know what we need right now is a whole
bunch of shade.

55
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,200
A big umbrella or a really big tree.

56
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,443
Or maybe I could grow into
a giant cactus and smile down

57
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:52,420
onto all of you as I provide
cool, refreshing comfort.

58
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,421
It's official.

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,100
The sun has just turned Palmon's brain
into a french fry.

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,560
Earth to Palmon.

61
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,780
Come in.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Palmon?

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,440
Ah!

64
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
No!

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,920
Wowie!

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
I did that?

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,060
Gee, I'm pretty amazing.

68
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:12,620
Yeah.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,020
You better believe it, Palmon.

70
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,840
Come on, everybody.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
Let's head for some shade.

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Yeah!

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Woohoo!

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:20,680
Woohoo!

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Woohoo!

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Go on!

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,000
What happened to the shade?

78
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Huh?

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,540
It was just a mirage.

80
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
We've been tricked.

81
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,320
Well, well.

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,360
It's about time you got here.

83
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,300
I was just about ready to give up on you.

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
It's Jedi!

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,920
Jedi, we found the tags and a couple of
crests like you wanted, but when we got

86
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,260
it, it's coming to trouble our Digimon
couldn't Digivolve.

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,360
They ended up worse off than when they
started.

88
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Take a look at poor Agumon.

89
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,260
He is just not himself.

90
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,280
And I'm supposed to be helping him.

91
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,780
I think those thingies are more trouble
than they're worth.

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,260
Calm down, kids.

93
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Let me explain.

94
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,480
The tags and crests are extremely
important.

95
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,060
Please make sure no one else gets a hold
of them.

96
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,441
In the end, you shall
see that they will work

97
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:19,161
together to help you
create total harmony.

98
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
In English?

99
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,140
Just trust me.

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,260
After all, I'm the floating glowing guy.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,907
As for Coromon, he
wouldn't be so helpless if you

102
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,100
had known how to care
for him in the proper way.

103
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,640
But I did the best I could.

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,500
Patience is what you need to learn,
my friends, and you will learn it in time.

105
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,680
But I want to have Agumon back now.

106
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,820
I'm starting to lose my connection.

107
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,280
That's something you're going to have to
figure out all by yourself.

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Good luck.

109
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
Wait a minute!

110
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,640
Sorry, I'm on a tight schedule.

111
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,620
It never fails.

112
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,660
Every time I need to know about something,
he hangs me out to dry.

113
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,660
Are we being cared for properly?

114
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,640
If we were, Agumon wouldn't have
digivolved backwards.

115
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,020
Come on!

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Don't freak me out!

117
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm better with computers.

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,760
That's ridiculous.

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,900
As far as I'm concerned, you're the best.

120
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,320
You look bummed.

121
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,220
How am I supposed to take care of you?

122
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
Is there a handbook somewhere?

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,980
I feel very inadequate.

124
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,981
Me too.

125
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Huh?

126
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,440
Is that a battleship?

127
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Could be.

128
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,020
But it looks more like a fancy cruise
ship.

129
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,220
The passengers will want their money back
when they see this place.

130
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,180
Yeah.

131
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,120
It could be just a mirage.

132
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah, it looks pretty real to me.

133
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,660
Talies!

134
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
Oh!

135
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh!

136
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,261
Ahoy!

137
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Huh?

138
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,720
Noomomon!

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Oh.

140
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,240
Hey fella, could all of us come aboard and
freshin' up?

141
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,200
If you don't mind, this needs a woman's
touch.

142
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Well, hey there, big boy.

143
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,140
Your ship looks so, so inviting.

144
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,020
How about letting us on board so that we
can check it out?

145
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,760
Oh, please?

146
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,260
Is it safe?

147
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, what?

148
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,660
No linen tablecloths?

149
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,680
Well, I guess we can rough it.

150
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Whoa!

151
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,460
Nice!

152
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:34,980
Look!

153
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,160
We can take a shower!

154
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm in heaven!

155
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,040
We can spend hours just pampering
ourselves!

156
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Totally yes!

157
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah, we were getting pretty smelly.

158
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,220
Oh, wow!

159
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
They've even got little tiny soap bars!

160
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Check out the incredible spread!

161
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,260
It appears to be highly edible.

162
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Might I propose we eat a bit and take the
leftovers with us?

163
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,900
Let's eat it all now!

164
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, I can't believe it!

165
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,900
Remember when the food was just an
illusion?

166
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,140
Another alien plot?

167
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,680
It doesn't smell like an alien plot.

168
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,620
Excuse me.

169
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,081
After extensive deliberation,
I've come to the conclusion

170
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:21,560
that it would be rude to allow
this cuisine to become cold.

171
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Yeah!

172
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,020
Let's go for it, guys!

173
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Yeah!

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,380
I'm confused, Joe.

175
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,173
What do you think Jedi
meant when he said we

176
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:44,080
weren't taking proper
care of our Digimon?

177
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,940
Uh, I don't know.

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,180
We've done everything but give him an
allowance.

179
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,060
Aha!

180
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,300
I see a couple have taken the bait.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,640
Time for me to get started!

182
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,740
They'll never forget this cruise.

183
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I'm Cockatrymon!

184
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,780
My cock-a-doodle-doo will blow out your
eardrums!

185
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,920
Mess with me and you'll be packed into
surrender!

186
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,721
Antimon will reward me
greatly when he learns

187
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,810
I've trapped the
Digi-Destined on my ship!

188
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,210
Ah!

189
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
Step it up, fools!

190
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,980
I'm getting very impatient here.

191
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,720
Know what I mean?

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,400
If my network's offline, then everybody
crashes.

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Let me tell you why.

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Because I'm Antimon!

195
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,320
You don't want to make something of it?

196
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
No way!

197
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
You'll

198
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,560
scream and shout!

199
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,160
Cause I'm the hippest Digimon in town!

200
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Oh, yeah!

201
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,980
So who gave you permission to dance?

202
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Now y'all get back to work before I get
myself upset again!

203
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah!

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Something's wrong.

205
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
Edemon's network appears to be down.

206
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
Ah, who needs him?

207
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,160
I'll have the pleasure of plastering their
feathers all by myself.

208
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,440
Cock-a-caw-caw-caw-caw-caw!

209
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,460
It's amazing how my brains surpass my good
looks.

210
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
Now hear this.

211
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,960
I have an important message for ya.

212
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,920
Listen up!

213
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,800
This is the deal.

214
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,674
I'll give you Numamon an
extra serving of dried bread

215
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,280
and even throw in some
jelly if you capture those kids.

216
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,840
They need me!

217
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,420
Ah!

218
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,540
Don't you know I'm claustrophobic?

219
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,540
What's gotten into you Numamon?

220
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
No!

221
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,760
You better keep your hands off!

222
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Digivolve!

223
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Digimon!

224
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,080
Digimon!

225
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Digimon!

226
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,680
Digimon!

227
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:30,760
Digimon!

228
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Digimon!

229
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,200
Digimon!

230
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,880
Digimon!

231
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:34,900
Digimon!

232
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:34,900
Digimon!

233
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Digimon!

234
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:35,980
Digimon!

235
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,220
Digimon!

236
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:37,221
Digimon!

237
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Digimon!

238
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
Digimon!

239
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Digimon!

240
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,680
Digimon!

241
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:43,681
Wow!

242
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,940
He's back!

243
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,640
Ah!

244
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Pepperbred!

245
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Point!

246
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Petra!

247
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Fire!

248
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Ah!

249
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,380
Poor Agumon!

250
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,381
Gomamon!

251
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,000
Look!

252
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,400
They left me a present!

253
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Oh!

254
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,000
Raa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

255
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,520
You're sucked without these!

256
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,180
But I wouldn't be too upset.

257
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,680
Now you've got yourself a couple of nice
Digimon garden ornaments!

258
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:44,860
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

259
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,440
It's your turn!

260
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:46,880
No!

261
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,540
Petra, fire!

262
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,400
They've been turned into rocks!

263
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,800
Impossible!

264
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Poor Tokomon!

265
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,140
Where are the rest of the children?

266
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,820
Uh, we don't know.

267
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,540
I'd do anything for a good moisturizing
shampoo.

268
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Ah!

269
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,500
You little chickenies think you're so
smart!

270
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Ah!

271
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,060
They won't get away that easily!

272
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,230
It's Han Katrina!

273
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,830
Is that the Easter chicken?

274
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,910
He's bad news!

275
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,270
But Head has Ty in Joe's turrets!

276
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,390
I ran into several of your friends over by
the pool.

277
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,510
Oh, but... Don't get
your heads in a spin!

278
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,810
They're just drying off!

279
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,430
Nothing like little sun-baked faces!

280
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,210
Fried to a crisp with curly corn spuds and
lots of coleslaw!

281
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,530
Oh!

282
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,770
Where are the Digimon?

283
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,470
Don't worry about those guys!

284
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,930
Confidentially, I find them to be a little
bit on the stiff side.

285
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,630
But that just happens to be my personal
opinion.

286
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,930
Your opinion stinks!

287
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,250
Now you're going to meet the same fate!

288
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,130
You've cackled once too often!

289
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,370
Spiral Twister!

290
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,170
Poison Ivy!

291
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,451
Petro... Fire!

292
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,810
Come back, you chickens!

293
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,990
Who's he calling chickens?

294
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,620
What do we do now?

295
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
We're trapped!

296
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Huh?

297
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Trap you!

298
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,180
Digimon!

299
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Do your stuff!

300
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Digimon!

301
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
Yeah!

302
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Digimon!

303
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Digimon!

304
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Digimon!

305
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Okay!

306
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,480
That has not zero!

307
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,740
Huh?

308
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,450
It's your turn.

309
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,570
Right.

310
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,570
Evolve 2!

311
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,200
Meteor wing!

312
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,790
Needle spring!

313
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,030
We're out of here!

314
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,710
I say we do the same as they are in an
abandoned ship.

315
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,190
I guess it's a little late for a mutiny.

316
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,170
Don't worry.

317
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,170
The captain's already been fricasseed.

318
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,910
Oh, my head!

319
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,410
You may have ruffled my tail feathers,
but I can still...

320
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,230
Okay, so maybe I've lost a little bit of
my doodle, but I'm not finished yet.

321
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,810
Oh!

322
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,890
Well, the weather sure hasn't gotten any
cooler.

323
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,731
Oh... Do you hear something?

324
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,850
Huh?

325
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,880
That's one mad Digimon with his feathers
at a joint!

326
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,450
What were you expecting?

327
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,630
An outlet mall?

328
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,530
Hurry!

329
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,970
Get over on the other side!

330
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:38,450
I can fly!

331
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,170
I can fly!

332
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,910
Oh, I can't fly!

333
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:43,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh!

334
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,390
Bigger

335
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
than a skyscraper!

336
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,400
You're right!

337
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,720
What's a skyscraper, Mimi?

338
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,770
Look up there!

339
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,150
Check it out, you guys!

340
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,870
Oh!

341
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,960
Maybe it's a crest!

342
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:36,961
Oh!

343
00:18:37,500 --> 00:19:10,430
He was right!

344
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,690
It's just like Jenai said!

345
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,890
The tags and crests somehow work together,
Mimi!

346
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,350
Oh?

347
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,890
It's the crest of sincerity!

348
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,230
I don't deserve it, but if it'll help me
take care of Palmon, I'll keep it!

349
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,780
Thanks, Mimi!

350
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,140
But I think I'm gonna have to teach you
some manners!

351
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,560
Do you know that you slurp when you eat
soup?

352
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,140
But don't worry, a single leaf on that
pretty little head!

353
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,160
Mimi's gonna teach you...

354
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,740
Sure, Mimi is sort of a ditz, but she's
really sincere and a good friend!

355
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,160
That's why she ended up with the crest of
sincerity!

356
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,440
If you ask me, that was a good call!

357
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Totally cool!
