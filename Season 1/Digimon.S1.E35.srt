1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,440
Wizardmon, a longtime friend of Gatomon,
was able to make her remember that she was

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:08,140
to be the Digimon of the Eighth Child, who
turned out to be my little sister, Kari.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,140
Gatomon had been waiting in the Digi-World
for a long time, and when Kari didn't show

4
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:16,020
up, Myotismon took her under his grizzly
wing and convinced her that she was evil.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,623
Our new friends then
tried to get the true crest

6
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,680
from Myotismon's lair,
but he surprised them.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,500
Good news is, he didn't know that Kari was
the Eighth Child.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,020
Bad news is, he's using Gatomon to find
out who is.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,500
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,620
Change into digital champions to save the
digital world!

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,200
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

12
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,540
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

13
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,160
Due to the continuing heavy fog, we'll
be experiencing some delays up ahead.

14
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,580
Please bear with us.

15
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,580
Ha!

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,100
It's almost done.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Soon now, not in fire or ice, but in fog,
this world will be mine!

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,380
Yuck!

19
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,720
This soil's polluted!

20
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,820
Tastes like gasoline and old candy
wrappers.

21
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,640
I've got this bottled water.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,140
Try it.

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,040
It's fresh and pure as a winter morning in
the Swiss Alps.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,420
At least that's what it says on the
bottle.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,960
Okay, pour it on my roots.

26
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:20,961
Mmm!

27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,450
Yummy!

28
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,730
Yodley-poo!

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,390
Hush!

30
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,770
Hmm?

31
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:32,910
Mimi?

32
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,850
Is that you?

33
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,330
Mimi, what are you doing out here?

34
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,210
Oh!

35
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,190
Hi, Dad!

36
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,690
You should be inside.

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,530
Well, you see, I was just waiting for you!

38
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,770
Huh?

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,510
So, Dad, why are you so late, anyway?

40
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
It's this fog.

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,430
It's got everything tied up in knots.

42
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,570
Say, what's that you got under your hat
there?

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,010
Oh!

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,450
It's just, uh, uh... Ooh!

45
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,330
Burr, it's getting cold out here.

46
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,830
We better hurry up and get home or Mom
will be worried.

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,910
Hi, honey!

48
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,050
Hello!

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,130
Sorry.

50
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,470
I could have pretended you were my doll or
a stuffed animal, I suppose.

51
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,210
But I have a reputation for good taste to
maintain.

52
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,770
I'm in bad taste?

53
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,150
Is that what you're saying?

54
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,790
Oh, Palmon, I didn't mean it that way.

55
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,630
Really?

56
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,550
I made this dish up myself.

57
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,590
Well, I call it shrimp fried rice with
whipped cream and strawberries.

58
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,370
Well...

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,866
You've really outdone yourself this time,
honey.

60
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,530
You mean it?

61
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,370
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

62
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,290
You mean it?

63
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,910
I mean it.

64
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,550
Really?

65
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,890
Really.

66
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,350
I can't believe I got a C.

67
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,690
There goes med school and my dad wanted me
to call right away and tell him my grades.

68
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,710
A C?

69
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,110
Forget about my oldest mom.

70
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,370
This is a real disaster.

71
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,970
You're right.

72
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,270
Clearly this grade is the result of all
the stress from the monster attacks.

73
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,990
Well, if you can't get into medical
school, I'd try politics.

74
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,470
Oh, no!

75
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,890
Give me a break.

76
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,070
Come on.

77
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,470
Huh?

78
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,650
Aw, man.

79
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,810
Right when it was about to get to the best
part.

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,020
Hey, what's going on, Charlie?

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,940
You're awake.

82
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,320
I was just coming to get you.

83
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,720
The whole system's gone down.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
Transmitters, satellite feed, the whole
shebang.

85
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,840
What?

86
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,280
If it's a systems glitch, it's like the
Godzilla of all systems glitches.

87
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:37,856
But we can't even check it out because
communications are down too.

88
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
It's like the end of the world or
something.

89
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,500
No one will escape.

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,520
No one.

91
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,940
Not even the eighth child.

92
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,620
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

93
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:55,840
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

94
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,120
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

95
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,340
Due to a systems failure, all trains will
be delayed indefinitely.

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,440
We apologize for the inconvenience.

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,880
The payphones don't work either.

98
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
What's going on?

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
Everything's falling apart.

100
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
It could be worse.

101
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,620
We could be stuck on the train.

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
Everything started going wonky ever since
that fog came in.

103
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,220
Even my cell phone isn't working.

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,720
Of course, it wasn't working before,
but still.

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey, where are you going?

106
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
To earn my pay.

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,140
To investigate this thing.

108
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
That's what I do, after all.

109
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:34,960
We'll come with you.

110
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,020
Believe in yourself.

111
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,820
Say it.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,300
I believe in me.

113
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Good.

114
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,450
Hey, Ty.

115
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,190
Do you think Gato Mom's okay?

116
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,590
Sure she is, Kari.

117
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,390
First thing tomorrow, we'll go find her.

118
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:51,950
Don't worry.

119
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,670
I think we'd better go to bed.

120
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,730
We'll need our rest to fight my Otis Mom.

121
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,890
Don't want to fall asleep on the job,
do ya?

122
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,090
Okay.

123
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,390
You scared, Kari?

124
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,050
Not really.

125
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,130
Atta girl.

126
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,930
Leave everything to me.

127
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,570
I'm dying my clothes pink again.

128
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,830
Okay.

129
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,190
Looks like Dad's working late again.

130
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,240
Something weird's going on.

131
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,600
We're just getting our child down.

132
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,720
The fog's disrupting our entire area.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,540
Why isn't any other part of town seeing
fog?

134
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,680
It's like some alien powers controlling
the fog bank with magic or something.

135
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,160
Magic?

136
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,700
Stop trying to scare me.

137
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Keep quiet.

138
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,690
What's that?

139
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:49,691
Shh!

140
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,870
Keep it down.

141
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,290
You both saw it?

142
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:52,890
Mm-hmm.

143
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,470
Good.

144
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,170
At least I know I'm not the only one going
crazy.

145
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,690
What's the connection?

146
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,690
Somehow the fog's tied in with these
monsters we keep seeing.

147
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,630
Let the humans scream.

148
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,130
It doesn't bother us, Gizamon.

149
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,410
We travel in packs creating terror,
whether on land or under water.

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,990
Everyone, get in the car!

151
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,370
An impenetrable fog has sealed off the
main district of the city.

152
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,770
Incoming reports also
verify that all communication

153
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:28,131
systems appear to have
been rendered useless.

154
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,550
I'm coming, Matt.

155
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,270
TK!

156
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,950
I have to go!

157
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,790
You don't understand.

158
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,810
Whatever happens, they'll need me there.

159
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,010
Mm-mm.

160
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,330
Aw, Mom.

161
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,830
Matt is there.

162
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,250
And so is Dad.

163
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,210
We can't just leave them.

164
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,490
Oh.

165
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,130
All right, then.

166
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,290
We'll go together.

167
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,650
Get your coat, son.

168
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,230
Yeah.

169
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,510
Wake up, son.

170
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,870
Get up and get dressed.

171
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,110
Uh... What is it?

172
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,970
Dad, what happened to you?

173
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,150
I'll tell you later.

174
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,630
Just get up and get dressed, okay?

175
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,390
Joe, where are you going?

176
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,630
Down to the pier.

177
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,330
Maybe we can get in by boat.

178
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,310
An announcement will be made when service
has been restored.

179
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,210
We apologize for any inconvenience.

180
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,470
What in the world is that thing?

181
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,330
I'm Phantoman.

182
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,050
I'm Phantoman.

183
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,027
You don't want to be near
me or my frightening little

184
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:30,730
friends when I start to
swing my... shadow side.

185
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,130
My Otifman requests your presence and he
won't take no for an answer.

186
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,750
Are you really going to soccer practice
today?

187
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,110
Ty will be there and I really need to talk
to him about our plan of attack.

188
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,990
Besides, I could use the practice.

189
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,770
Mom!

190
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,970
I'm going to soccer.

191
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,770
Mom?

192
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,350
Well, I'll see you in a little bit.

193
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,170
Oh great.

194
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,270
The phone's still out.

195
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,550
Oh, your poor father.

196
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,250
I hope he's not stuck in the subway.

197
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,630
We're not watching that video again.

198
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,230
The TV's still out, sweetie.

199
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,610
I wonder who'd be dropping by unannounced.

200
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,930
Coming!

201
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,590
Hello?

202
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,990
All right, we're all safe now.

203
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,630
But honey, what are they?

204
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,050
It's a long story, Mom!

205
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,330
Oh my God!

206
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,730
Spiral Twister!

207
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,410
You just talked!

208
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,210
I saw you!

209
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,410
I thought you were a stuffed animal!

210
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,970
Well, life's full of surprises.

211
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,210
Where's the soccer field?

212
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,650
It's down at the school!

213
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,090
Why do you ask?

214
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,550
All you need to know is, Sora's in
trouble.

215
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,710
I've got to find her.

216
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,310
We'll start by separating the children
from their parents.

217
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,010
Ah, how they'll scream and weep delicious.

218
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,730
I guess you're not as powerful here in the
real world as you thought you'd be.

219
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,337
Power isn't anything
I'd concern myself with if

220
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:23,850
I were you, especially
since you don't have any.

221
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,350
You little traitor.

222
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,730
Now will you tell me what happened,
Dad?

223
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,250
I hardly know myself.

224
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,170
But I want you to stay here.

225
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,450
Out of sight.

226
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,570
Where are you going?

227
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,390
The station.

228
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,550
To try to find some way to communicate
with the outside world.

229
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,310
Smoke signals.

230
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,510
Anything.

231
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,770
You'll be safe here.

232
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,010
Stay with Gabumon.

233
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,690
How do you know about me?

234
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,090
But Dad, how?

235
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,950
Never mind how.

236
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,870
Just be safe.

237
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,950
You know, I think he likes me.

238
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,810
Agumon!

239
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,630
Digivolve!

240
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,770
To...

241
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,870
Graymon!

242
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,070
Oh no!

243
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,190
Another monster!

244
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,470
Don't worry.

245
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,130
This monster's on our side.

246
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,810
Get my mom, Graymon!

247
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,230
Hurry!

248
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,270
Shadow side!

249
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,510
Well, Graymon, it looks like your time is
up.

250
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,410
Get the rest of the crowd.

251
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,770
No!

252
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,010
No!

253
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,670
No!

254
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,970
Nova Blast!

255
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,810
Sorry, Ty.

256
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,890
I'm losing it.

257
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,130
We'll get your mom later.

258
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,330
Right now, we've got to get out of here.

259
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,310
Mommy!

260
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,570
Oh, we'll be there!

261
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,460
Ty!

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,340
We'll follow them and find out where
they've taken her.

263
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,860
But will it work?

264
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,060
We'll see.

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,960
Sora!

266
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
It's you!

267
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,820
Oh no, Mimi.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,720
They got you too.

269
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,140
Psst!

270
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:45,780
I can digivob anytime!

271
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Just say the word!

272
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,420
There's too many people, and too many of
them.

273
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,460
Let's see how this plays out.

274
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,340
You'll be our trump card for later.

275
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,400
Got it!

276
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,820
I can't stand it!

277
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
I can't stand not knowing!

278
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,980
Calm down, dear.

279
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
How can I calm down?

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,880
For all we know, that monster's devoured
the children by now!

281
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,140
Don't worry.

282
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,060
He's one of ours.

283
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,500
Huh?

284
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
There's a lot more where he came from.

285
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,980
We've got some powerful friends.

286
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,100
Besides, we've got truth and justice and
all that good stuff on our side.

287
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,260
Well, if you can't beat him, join him!

288
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,520
Now let's go inside and find Sora!

289
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:17,960
Right!

290
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,420
Wait, this may be a strange question,
but did Sora ever say, Did she tell you,

291
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,960
Does Sora hate me?

292
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,420
What?

293
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,540
Oh boy, do you have it wrong!

294
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,900
Then I realized I was worried about you
just the way my mother worries about me.

295
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,300
And now I know for sure.

296
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,420
My mom loved me all along.

297
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,900
And it was your love that helped me
digivolve, Sora!

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm glad.

299
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,320
Sora...

300
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,060
How could it be worse?

301
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,890
You could work for
minimum wage in a foam

302
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,840
rubber suit with kids
kicking you all the time!

303
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,440
Right, guys?

304
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
Right!

305
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
What is it, Mom?

306
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,260
I just can't stay in this place one second
longer!

307
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,781
Well, you've been wanting to get away.

308
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
Look at this as a vacation.

309
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,140
Who asked you to talk?

310
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm sorry, children.

311
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
I didn't mean to yell.

312
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,536
It's just that I'm not used to being held
captive by creatures from another world.

313
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,260
Don't worry, lady.

314
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,160
You'll get used to it.

315
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,840
But I don't want to get used to it!

316
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,680
I want to go home and sleep in my own bed!

317
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,100
I want to live life to the fullest!

318
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,940
I want to clean lint out of my dryer!

319
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,640
I want to pick up after my doggy!

320
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,000
I want to know what's happening on my soap
operas!

321
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,580
I'm so glad I got that off my chest!

322
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,420
Enough of this!

323
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,320
We need a plan!

324
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah, Jeremiah.

325
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,249
Why don't you help
us instead of listening

326
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,100
to those Mind Over
Matter tapes all the time?

327
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
What'd you say?

328
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,280
The only way to weaken Bakuman is with
Mind Over Matter!

329
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,820
Huh?

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,760
Mind over what?

331
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,360
It's an old Roman technique.

332
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,640
You repeat a phrase over and over again
and it helps you focus your mind!

333
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,620
That's it!

334
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,738
We need some of you to attack
the Bakuman creating a diversion

335
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,240
while the rest of us come up
with a Mind Over Matter chant!

336
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,560
What's that mean?

337
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,360
Just do what she says, alright?

338
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,220
Half of you come with me!

339
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Let's get em!

340
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,340
Women and children, follow me!

341
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,710
Bakuman, lose your powers!

342
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,430
Bakuman, lose your powers!

343
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,250
Bakuman, lose your powers!

344
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,070
Bakuman, lose your powers!

345
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,670
We made it!

346
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,030
We're safe at last!

347
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh, smoke too soon!

348
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,130
It's Dark Tyranimon!

349
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,650
It's Dark Tyranimon!

350
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:26,127
He was actually a nice guy
once until he was taken over

351
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:29,230
by an evil computer virus
and his personality did a 180!

352
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,030
Huh?

353
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,390
Where are you going?

354
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,170
You couldn't be in safer hands!

355
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,600
Come on, did you evolve too?

356
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Togomon!

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,800
Back to the stone age with you!

358
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,780
Dad!

359
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Dad!

360
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Honeybunch, are you okay?

361
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,500
I guess I made a fool of myself,
huh?

362
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,460
Don't be ridiculous!

363
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,520
That was the bravest thing I ever saw!

364
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:00,521
Really?

365
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:00,920
Really?

366
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,320
Really?

367
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
You mean it?

368
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
I mean it!

369
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Oh, honey!

370
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,180
Oh, Mom!

371
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,560
Dad!

372
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,061
I hate to ruin this love fest, but maybe
we should run for cover or something!

373
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
No!

374
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Togomon!

375
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,180
It's no use!

376
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Save yourself!

377
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,120
I got it under control, no problem!

378
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,400
This is the end!

379
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,020
It's over!

380
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:28,021
Yeah!

381
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,500
Yeah!

382
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,060
My Ohisman will rule the world!

383
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Ah!

384
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Oh!

385
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
This is terrible!

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,940
Now my family's going to suffer and so are
my friends!

387
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,680
There's got to be something I can do!

388
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
Huh?

389
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Digimon!

390
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,640
Digimon!

391
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,480
Digimon!

392
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,080
Digimon!

393
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:48,180
Digimon!

394
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,140
Digimon!

395
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Digimon!

396
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Digimon!

397
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
Digimon!

398
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,130
Where'd she come from?

399
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,210
Flower cannon!

400
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,590
Whoa!

401
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,090
Who are you?

402
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,890
It's just little old me!

403
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,210
Or should I say little old us?

404
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,010
I'm Palmon and Togomon too!

405
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,130
This is just my fully digivolved form!

406
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,890
You can call me Lillimon!

407
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,070
Am I?

408
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,190
In bad taste?

409
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,270
No way!

410
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,610
I'm sorry I ever said the...

411
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,090
No biggie!

412
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,210
You have to be quicker than that!

413
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,830
Be careful!

414
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,350
Your wish to save your family and friends
brought me into existence!

415
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,691
Mimi, you're a very special girl, even
though your wardrobe sometimes clashes!

416
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,850
What do you mean?

417
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,770
Later!

418
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,070
Right now I have a dinosaur to tame!

419
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,670
My flower wreath counteracted
the evil computer virus,

420
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:09,350
so he oughta be as gentle
as a lamb from now on!

421
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,890
Nice to run him on!

422
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,050
That boy!

423
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,890
Please bear with us!

424
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,330
I should have known!

425
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,311
What made me think the boats would be
running when nothing else is?

426
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,130
It could be worse!

427
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,311
We could be stuck in some crazy...
Please stop saying it could be worse!

428
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,590
I have news for you, pal!

429
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,190
It is worse!

430
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,350
The whole world is stuck in turmoil and
we're waiting for a ride into town!

431
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,230
We might as well just give up right now!

432
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,350
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

433
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,790
After all, it could be worse!

434
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,130
Huh?

435
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,360
Maybe if I can just get to that satellite
dish.

436
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,030
You okay, Agumon?

437
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,250
I felt better.

438
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,190
Ty!

439
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,030
Huh?

440
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,770
Up here!

441
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,450
Matt!

442
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,430
Is that you?

443
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,110
Hey, we gotta talk!

444
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,410
You feel any better?

445
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,210
A lot better!

446
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,050
Thanks, Kari!

447
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,390
What?

448
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,590
You're kidding me!

449
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,770
No, it's true.

450
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,150
Kari's the eighth child.

451
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,650
Enough!

452
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:06,890
Get off!

453
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,530
That new-age drichobabble won't help you
where you're going, my pretty little miss.

454
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,970
Seize her!

455
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,050
Take it away!

456
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,670
What?

457
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,750
Oh,

458
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,110
it's just a bird.

459
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,730
A large bird, I grant you.

460
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,390
A large, angry bird!

461
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,970
Sarah!

462
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,130
Oh, Mom.

463
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,770
I'm so... There's
no time now, honey.

464
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,390
You've got to get out of here.

465
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:35,850
Hurry!

466
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,150
But what about you?

467
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,030
Get moving!

468
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,150
I'll be fine!

469
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,470
No, Mother!

470
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,470
We'll see about that.

471
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,610
Back to the digital world with you!

472
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,970
You are such a bad sport!

473
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,350
You, meddlesome little flower child!

474
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,250
It's time I plucked your petals!

475
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,870
Crimson Lightning!

476
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,252
Will Lilymon withstand
Myotismon's Crimson

477
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,630
Lightning, or will Mimi
lose her best friend?

478
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,910
Next time on Digimon Digital Monsters.
