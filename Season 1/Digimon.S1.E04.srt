1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
I guess it's my turn to fill you guys in.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,160
First, we have a close call with these
twin metal dinosaur-looking creatures.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,400
Then, when we're about to crash for the
night, wouldn't you know it?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,873
We're camped out right
on top of a big wicked

5
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:14,841
serpent thing who goes
by the name of Seedramon.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,880
That's when things got intense.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,640
I got snatched up and Gabumon digivolved
into a huge blue wolf called Garurumon.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,680
Lucky for me, Seedramon was no match.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,580
Whenever we're in danger, our Digimons get
bigger and help us.

10
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:30,160
Now THAT'S COOL!

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,440
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,020
Change into digital champions to save the
digital world.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,100
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,260
Digimon, Digimon are the champions.

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,500
Digimon, enter champions.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,960
Digimon, enter champions.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,080
Digimon, Digimon are the champions.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,340
Digimon, digimon...

19
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,050
Whoa, hey!

20
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,870
Whoa, did you hear that?

21
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,790
It seems to be some sort of aircraft.

22
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,010
It looked like a big flying gear.

23
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,490
Admit it, my alien theory is becoming more
plausible.

24
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,650
Yeah, they hit us with an anti-gravity ray
to make us all crooked.

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,370
Or maybe that sign's just crooked.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:58,730
Whoa!

27
00:01:58,731 --> 00:01:59,731
TK!

28
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,890
That was scary.

29
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,170
Watch it.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,230
That could have been a snake, or worse.

31
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,810
Oh boy, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,750
Hey, Biomon, are there really snakes here?

33
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,570
No, just giant flying killer bugs and
other unpleasant Digimon.

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,490
Don't you worry, TK.

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,970
I'll take care of them.

36
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,190
Okay, now that that's settled,
let's get going.

37
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:24,110
Nothing's settled, and where would we go?

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,670
We don't even know where we are.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,530
This is silly.

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,130
I say we keep moving and see if we can
find any signs of intelligent life here.

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,010
Hey, wait a minute.

42
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,050
Is he saying that Digimon are not
intelligent?

43
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,670
Is that what he's saying?

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,910
Not at all.

45
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,190
But I think Ty is right.

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,970
We need to keep moving in hopes of finding
out where we are.

47
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,210
We need to stay calm and stick together.

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,410
Let's remember, we're in this together.

49
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,570
Together sounds good.

50
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:49,630
We can do it.

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,750
This will take teamwork.

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,990
And I'm sure we'll figure out exactly
where we are and how to get back.

53
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,230
There's no point in splitting up because
then, once somebody did figure it out, we...

54
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,150
Hey, Sora, open your eyes.

55
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,610
Well, thanks a lot for waiting.

56
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,390
Moving right along, folks.

57
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,270
Keep it moving.

58
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,130
Our next stop on the tour will be the
forest of irrelevant road signs.

59
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,550
No pictures, please.

60
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,650
We're lost and these guys are making
jokes.

61
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,870
Hey, wait up.

62
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,950
My shoelace is broken.

63
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,270
You need new shoes.

64
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,750
Ooh, new shoes.

65
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,650
Look!

66
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,010
Telephone poles.

67
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,130
I say we follow them and see where they
lead.

68
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,570
They'll just lead to trouble.

69
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,730
Look, it's the alien saucer again.

70
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,470
And it's headed for a close encounter.

71
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,810
Why, it's so hot I can feel the heat
coming up through my socks.

72
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,570
Well, TK, maybe you should put your shoes
back on.

73
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,710
Oh, this hot desert air is destroying my
complexion.

74
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,130
How much further is it?

75
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,930
Is that all you're worried about,
Mimi?

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,950
We'll be lucky if we even survive this
hike.

77
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,591
Hey, does anybody besides me see that these
telephone poles have no connecting wires?

78
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,670
She's right.

79
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,070
I wonder if these actually are telephone
poles.

80
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,330
Maybe they're some odd alien equivalent.

81
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,070
Hey, remember those phone booths and that
streetcar?

82
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,450
Yeah, what about them?

83
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,451
Oh, nothing.

84
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,510
I was just wondering if anybody else
remembered.

85
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,070
That's it.

86
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:15,790
Doomed.

87
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,510
The heat has baked our brains and we're
all gonna end up like roasted piglets.

88
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,770
Just remain calm, Joe.

89
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,550
We've only been walking for two minutes.

90
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,110
Izzy, come here, Izzy.

91
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,950
I think we'd better find some shade for
Joe.

92
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,090
And quick.

93
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,430
You won't believe what happened to my
favorite watch.

94
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,650
Hmm?

95
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,310
What?

96
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,990
The sun melted the numbers right off.

97
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,490
Mimi, for somebody who hates hiking,
you sure have a lot of compasses.

98
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,630
Huh?

99
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,890
Of course, none of them actually work.

100
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,710
Oh, this dirt contains small traces of
metal which could affect the compass needle.

101
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,350
Oh, well.

102
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
I'm always late anyway.

103
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,970
This is one weird world and I don't like
it one little bit.

104
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,150
I think we should start looking for water,
guys.

105
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,670
Otherwise, we could dehydrate in all this
heat.

106
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,950
Yeah.

107
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,230
But we're doing okay for now, aren't we?

108
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,690
Help!

109
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,030
I've taken a soil sample,
measured the barometric

110
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:20,050
pressure, and analyzed
the relative humidity.

111
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,510
And what did you find out?

112
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,450
It's really, really hot.

113
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,190
Hang on just a little longer.

114
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Don't give up now.

115
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,890
We're gonna be okay.

116
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,090
Just keep moving along.

117
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,270
My head is baking.

118
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,790
If this goes on too much longer,
I'm going to look like a wilted salad.

119
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,830
Here, you wear my hat for a while.

120
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,290
Well, you need it more than I do.

121
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,290
Thank you, Mimi.

122
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,670
Hey, you.

123
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,310
What's that yucky smell?

124
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,070
Ugh.

125
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,590
Here's a thought.

126
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,650
Now you know why they call them sweat
socks.

127
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,070
This beach would be a lot more popular if
it just had a couple more things.

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,610
Like an ocean, a gentle breeze,
snack bar, hunky lifeguards.

129
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,370
Hold it.

130
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,610
I have to stop.

131
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,530
I just don't think that I can go any
faster.

132
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,930
You have to stay positive.

133
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,730
Let's all pretend that it's rainy.

134
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,950
Yeah!

135
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,390
That's a great idea.

136
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,910
I simply adore the rain.

137
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,610
Me too, but it's time for a reality check.

138
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,930
This isn't getting any better.

139
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,670
It might be a good idea to turn around and
get out of this desert right now.

140
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,270
You mean before we all have a power
outage?

141
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,030
I'll vote for that.

142
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,290
Wait.

143
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,430
Hold on for just a second, everybody.

144
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,890
If I'm seeing what I think
I'm seeing... What is it, Ty?

145
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:33,470
Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,610
Mm-hmm.

147
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,090
It's not a mirage.

148
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,390
It's real water.

149
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,190
Water?

150
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,870
This is fantastic.

151
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,130
Now all we need are some lemon,
sugar, and some big fat ice cubes.

152
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,250
That looks like a village.

153
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,450
Maybe we'll find people.

154
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,610
And Shaggy.

155
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,390
Maybe they'll have hats for sale.

156
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,030
Hang on.

157
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,230
Water and food.

158
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,950
I'm hungry enough to eat broccoli.

159
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,330
What's broccoli?

160
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,410
Is that a joke?

161
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,130
Great.

162
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,670
Let's get out of this desert.

163
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:56,671
Yay!

164
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
Hooray!

165
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,250
From so far away, everything looks so big.

166
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,650
But they're so cute and tiny.

167
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,070
Okay, question.

168
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,790
Who here knows where we can get a drink?

169
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,030
And just what do Giant Digimon drink?

170
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,550
Me?

171
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,730
I'm no Digimon.

172
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,090
My friend Zora is what's called a human
being.

173
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,470
Yes, we know they look funny.

174
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,850
In spite of this, they are all actually
very nice.

175
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,070
What's a human being?

176
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,530
If you are not Digimon, what are you doing
here in DigiWorld?

177
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,190
This is great.

178
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,430
There is no way we are all going to fit
into this place.

179
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,230
Relax, Joe.

180
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,950
At least the natives here are friendly.

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,850
Oh, my.

182
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,948
I would just love to
take one home and put it

183
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,150
on my bed with all my
other stuffed animals.

184
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:53,990
Hmph.

185
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,470
There she goes again.

186
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,070
Do you think Mimi hears the same things we
hear?

187
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,570
I'm not sure anymore.

188
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,530
Maybe she's an alien spy.

189
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,390
Kike is tired and hungry.

190
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,010
He's not the only one.

191
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,630
Beelon, just when did you digivolve?

192
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,930
When I met Sora, we share a special bond
which is magical.

193
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,850
You don't talk like us anymore.

194
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,530
Is that how all Beelon talk?

195
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,570
No, it's how the big ones talk.

196
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,830
I suppose I just picked it up from Sora.

197
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,870
She is a wonderful and kind human being
and I've already learned a lot from her.

198
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,630
We still don't understand how you
Digivolve.

199
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,990
What is it about being around human beings
that makes it happen?

200
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,570
Sora needed me.

201
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,070
I had to protect her.

202
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,330
She had to protect me?

203
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,850
Power came flowing through me.

204
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,490
I didn't know why I was.

205
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:37,970
Wait a sec.

206
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,730
Now I get it.

207
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,570
That's why she's always following me
around.

208
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,610
All of a sudden I realized I had
Digivolve.

209
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,470
When Tai needed him, Agamon Digivolve to
Graymon to protect him.

210
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,550
And Gururumon did the same for Matt.

211
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,410
They Digivolve for us.

212
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,410
We're lucky kids.

213
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,030
Sora!

214
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,610
We're invited to have dinner with the
Yoko's.

215
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,186
They said they'd be willing to share their
food with all of us.

216
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,210
Oh, wow.

217
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,430
Yay!

218
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,590
I wonder what they will be serving.

219
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,650
Perhaps some bone with meat?

220
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,090
Lettuce topped with fish?

221
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,450
Water!

222
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,190
Water!

223
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,750
Water!

224
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:13,870
Water?

225
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:14,470
Look everybody!

226
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,010
A fresh water fountain!

227
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,830
Hooray!

228
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,510
All of the water here is piped in from a
spring at Mihirashi Mountain.

229
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,210
It's the best water in the world.

230
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,450
Forget the world.

231
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,210
Mount Mihirashi water is the best in all
the galaxy.

232
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,690
Where's Mount Mihirashi?

233
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,830
Out there!

234
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,690
That's a live volcano.

235
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,850
Yes, but the heat boils away all the
germs.

236
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,390
If I'm not mistaken, that noise precedes
an eruption.

237
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,030
That's cold, but I still didn't get a
drink.

238
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,870
What is happening?

239
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,570
The water evaporated!

240
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,570
That's okay because the lake is always
full of water.

241
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,650
I'll check it out.

242
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,830
Let's all go.

243
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,070
The water's all gone!

244
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,030
Goodness, where did it go?

245
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,730
Somebody pulled the plug.

246
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,670
Alright, let's not panic.

247
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,810
Huh?

248
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,120
Dry as a bone.

249
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I won't give up.

250
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Huh?

251
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,160
Look!

252
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,960
Ty's doing a little dance for us!

253
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,780
Is that supposed to stop the fire or bring
down the rain?

254
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,540
Hey!

255
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,200
Do you remember that flying gear we saw
earlier?

256
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,460
It crashed right into a hillside.

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,500
Great.

258
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,080
Of all the hillsides out there,
the gear crashes into Mihirashi Mountain.

259
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,300
That's the place where the water comes
from.

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,400
That's right.

261
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,040
The water comes from a lake on the top of
Mount Mihirashi.

262
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,320
So a gear crashing into the mountain could
affect our water supply.

263
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Mm-hmm.

264
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,120
We don't dare go up there.

265
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,660
The mountain is guarded by a fiery Digimon
called Merimon.

266
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,240
He's hideously dangerous.

267
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,120
I want a closer look at that mountain.

268
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,240
You say this character Merimon is a fiery
Digimon?

269
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,540
What does he look like?

270
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Never mind!

271
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,700
There he is!

272
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
He's coming!

273
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
He's coming our way!

274
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,760
He burns up everything he touches!

275
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,280
He never comes down off the mountain
though!

276
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,780
This is very strange behavior for him!

277
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Ah!

278
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm burning!

279
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Too hard!

280
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,960
Merimon is a fiery Digimon!

281
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:15,280
There's no reason he should be in pain
from his own flames!

282
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
That's his nature!

283
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,260
This is weird!

284
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
He's crying!

285
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,160
Burning!

286
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,660
Sounds like he's out of his mind with
pain!

287
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
What do we do?

288
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,800
Burning!

289
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,440
Burning!

290
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Burning!

291
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
Burning!

292
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,600
Look!

293
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
He's coming straight toward the village!

294
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,180
Hey everybody!

295
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,980
We gotta understand what we're going to
do!

296
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
I've never seen him move so fast!

297
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:42,361
He's already reached the foot of the
mountain!

298
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
And now he's starting to enter the forest!

299
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:44,980
Ah!

300
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,420
Everybody freeze!

301
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,160
Stay very still!

302
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,120
You're gonna need more than sunscreen to
stop me!

303
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Don't move a muscle!

304
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,820
Burn!

305
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,460
Burn!

306
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Burn!

307
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Burn!

308
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Unfreeze!

309
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,110
Okay, settle down!

310
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,210
There's room for all of you!

311
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,650
Will you please stop squirming!

312
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,450
Here's the next batch, Matt!

313
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,330
Easy now!

314
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,130
You'll be okay!

315
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,370
Who's not here?

316
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,230
The Yoko's!

317
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,850
I'll take care of them!

318
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,450
This is bad!

319
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,610
Run!

320
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,310
Come on!

321
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,590
Everyone keep moving now!

322
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,166
Just follow the one in front of you!

323
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,510
Hey, you've got to save yourself!

324
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,310
Come down while there's still time!

325
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,330
I can't leave here until all my friends
are safe, Sora!

326
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,130
Alright!

327
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,010
I suppose I'll just have to come up there
after you then!

328
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,350
Hurry!

329
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,850
Sora, you'll never make it!

330
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,150
Hey, where's Sora going?

331
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,290
Sora, come back!

332
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,930
Oh, good!

333
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,210
They're all safe now!

334
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,410
Watch out!

335
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,690
Viamon!

336
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,910
He's right behind you!

337
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,310
Go away, Marymon!

338
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,110
Leave us alone!

339
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,390
We're not bothering you!

340
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,250
Viamon!

341
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:43,790
Viamon!

342
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,790
I'm coming, Viamon!

343
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,791
Woo!

344
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,810
Are you okay?

345
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,290
Sure!

346
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,070
I hope I never do that again!

347
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,330
It wasn't very fun!

348
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,930
Thank you for coming to rescue me!

349
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,110
Don't mention it!

350
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,310
That's what a friend is for!

351
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,470
You can say that again!

352
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,690
My friend!

353
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,710
Uh-oh!

354
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,190
We're still in great danger, Sora!

355
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:15,790
What?

356
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,170
You stay here!

357
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,890
It's my turn to rescue you now!

358
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,130
You think you're really hot stuff!

359
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,550
Well, you're in big trouble now!

360
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:24,810
And I'll spiral twister!

361
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,070
Ha!

362
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,280
Okay, Big Red, take that!

363
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
And that!

364
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,480
And that!

365
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:38,720
And that!

366
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,000
Is that the best you have to offer,
Wigley?

367
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,620
We gotta help her out!

368
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,040
He's too big to handle!

369
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,500
Yeah!

370
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,340
Yeah!

371
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Fireball!

372
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Catch!

373
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Oh no!

374
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
She's hit!

375
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Be your mom!

376
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,960
Come on, everyone!

377
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,360
We can beat that monster!

378
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,680
What we need is teamwork!

379
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm ready!

380
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Give him a shot!

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yikes!

382
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,110
We need a fire extinguisher!

383
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,310
That made him bigger!

384
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,550
Ugh!

385
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,790
Why do I suffer so?

386
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,010
If we knew why he was crying, it might
help to stop him!

387
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,190
Uh, fire's not affecting him!

388
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,630
I'm guessing it's not heartburn!

389
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,110
Maybe this monster just has growing pains!

390
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,250
Growing pains?

391
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,730
Meh!

392
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,070
This is not a time to joke!

393
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,090
Better get ready!

394
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,050
Here I come!

395
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:39,051
Ah!

396
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,930
Zara?

397
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,830
We're all in trouble now!

398
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,630
Merrimon can not be allowed to win!

399
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,710
My friends need my help now!

400
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,220
Come on!

401
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,140
Digivolve to...

402
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,980
Reimond Digivolve to rescue us!

403
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,970
What's wrong where you're not afraid of
me?

404
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,170
Let's fight!

405
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,510
Here!

406
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,830
Have a...

407
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Don't turn your back!

408
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:37,130
It was a gear!

409
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,030
What is it?

410
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,310
It made him crazy!

411
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,110
Right!

412
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,294
I suppose if you had
a big black gear stuck

413
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,091
inside of you, you'd
act a little crazy too!

414
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,250
The poor guy!

415
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,710
Yay!

416
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,290
Bill Mom did it!

417
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,080
Every time I'm in danger, Bill Mom comes
to my rescue.

418
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,600
That's what I call a friend.

419
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Are you alright?

420
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Oh, Sora!

421
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,700
Oh, B.

422
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,620
I was so worried about you.

423
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,020
You're great.

424
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,540
I can't begin to tell you how proud I am
of you.

425
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,440
I wasn't the least bit afraid.

426
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,600
All I could think about was saving you
because...

427
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,280
Well, you know...

428
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,840
Miramon, why did you attack our village?

429
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
I couldn't stop myself.

430
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,500
That must have been awful for you.

431
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,500
If you couldn't control yourself,
who was controlling you?

432
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,460
The last thing I remember is being hit by
that gear.

433
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,540
Well, we're just happy to see that you're
back to normal.

434
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,740
I hope nothing like this ever happens
again.

435
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,220
You're needed to protect Mount Mihirashi.

436
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,560
Goodbye, Miramon!

437
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,180
May you always stay well!

438
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,780
Goodbye!

439
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,480
And please, try not to burn down our
village anymore, okay?

440
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,340
Hey!

441
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,400
I just remembered you never got that
dinner we promised you.

442
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,500
You must be starving.

443
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,460
My tummy's ready for some action.

444
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,660
What is this stuff?

445
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,320
Be polite and just eat it.

446
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,860
A gracious guest never insults his host
cooking.

447
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,260
Hmm... I can't tell if it's even been
cooked.

448
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,820
Eat as much as you want.

449
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,420
We have more than enough for seconds.

450
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,820
Yeah, well, there's probably a good reason
for that.

451
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,120
You know, that's exactly what I was afraid
you were going to say.

452
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,940
It smells better than broccoli.

453
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Who knows?

454
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Might taste better.

455
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Has anybody noticed?

456
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,300
We talk a lot about food.

457
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,760
Nah, I'm not hungry.

458
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm skipping this one, too.

459
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,460
I just don't like to eat on an empty
stomach.

460
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,940
Besides, I don't even know what that stuff
is, but I'm sure I'm allergic to it.

461
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,820
And so ends my biggest adventure yet with
Beomar.

462
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,580
One thing's for certain, for being so
little, she sure has a huge heart.

463
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
and I can.

464
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
Batteria and
