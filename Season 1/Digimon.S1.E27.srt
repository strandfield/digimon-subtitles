1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,800
So everyone was finally reunited,
except Sora.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,070
She was still upset
because Demi-Devi-Mon told

3
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:07,920
her that her crest of
love would never glow.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,600
Demi-Devi-Mon and Myotismon unleashed a
vicious attack and really hurt Bi-O-Mon.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,260
The rest of the Digimon tried to help,
but Myotismon was too powerful.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,100
Bi-O-Mon wanted to fight, but Sora
protected her.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,523
That's when she realized
she was acting just

8
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:23,540
like a mom, protecting
someone she loved.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,354
Her crest then began to
glow, helping Berger-Mon

10
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:29,160
digivolve to Garuda-Mon and
stopping Myotismon's attack.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,060
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,620
Change into digital champions to save the
digital world!

13
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:03,720
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,680
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon!

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,100
Hey, check it out, Mimi!

17
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,020
How about this for an instant bath?

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm glad I took these bags from the
restaurant.

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,225
Gee, now you'll be able
to go soak your head

20
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:48,960
the next time you
have an allergy attack.

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,660
Right.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,120
That was so funny I forgot to laugh.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,557
Now that Myotismon's
chasing us, we're gonna have to

24
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,860
keep running like a bunch of
crazed shoppers at the mall.

25
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:58,900
No, he's just a big creep if you ask me.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,580
I'd have to agree with you on that.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,400
Yeah, he's small potatoes for us.

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,860
My wish is to never see him again,
period!

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,140
Mine too!

30
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,400
Gather round, everyone!

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,220
I hope lunch is ready because I'm
starving!

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Chennai's back!

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,660
He wants to speak to us!

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,780
Hope he's found a way to get us out of
here.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,380
Don't keep us in suspense!

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,740
What's this all about anyway?

37
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:22,160
Well, I brought you some good news and
some bad news.

38
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,880
Which would you like to hear first?

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,620
Save the good news for last.

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,940
I hate being depressed.

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,560
He's a basket case anyway.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,960
Let's start with the good news.

43
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,500
Actually, you all look like you could use
some cheering up.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,380
I've been told another child will be
joining your group.

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Another child?

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
Who tells you these things anyway?

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,820
Well, this is someone you shall want as a
friend.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,900
This someone is a digi-destined.

49
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:44,480
Really?

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Is there another one?

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,940
Oh, I hope this new one will have a
digi-mon that will be able to help us.

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
You and me both.

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,660
The important thing to remember is that
all eight of you must be together.

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,500
As long as you are separated, the worlds
will not be in harmony with each other.

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,160
Everything will go wacko, so we must find
that other child as soon as possible.

56
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,420
How do we do that?

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,880
Hmm.

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,060
I hope it's someone my size.

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,000
I hope she's my size so we can swap
clothes.

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,760
Tell us something about this kid.

61
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,020
Like, what's his or her name?

62
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,420
Uh, the name?

63
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Yeah.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
It's... I forgot.

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,741
And I... Calm down.

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,140
I do know the location of the child.

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,140
It's Japan.

68
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Huh?

69
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,040
Japan?

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,620
Where is Japan?

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,960
Japan's a big island in the Far East.

72
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,400
Agumon and Tai were transported there when
our two worlds converged.

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,800
Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,360
If they ever converge again, maybe we'll
all get to go home.

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:41,880
Yeah.

76
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,180
Remember, that was the good news.

77
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,760
Can't wait to hear the bad.

78
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,900
My Otis-mon has heard of the Eighth Child
and will be going to Japan soon.

79
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,620
He's gathering his forces as we speak.

80
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,320
If he gets to the child first,
both of our worlds will be doomed.

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,500
Doomed?

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,420
We need some spies on the inside.

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,850
Ah!

84
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,010
The noodle-brainer team!

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,230
Don't worry.

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,070
I'll whip them all into shape.

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,270
These dweebs will be unbeatable when I get
through with them.

88
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,630
Nanamon is an invader Digimon.

89
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,972
I'd tell him what I
really think about his

90
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,991
sunglasses, but his power
punch would flatten me.

91
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,410
Okay, big boy.

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,130
We know you can talk the talk, but
now it's time for you to do your stuff.

93
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:35,150
Just watch.

94
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,350
I don't wanna.

95
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,610
Can I help you two?

96
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,310
Yep.

97
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,690
We're a couple of renegade soldiers
looking for a battle to fight.

98
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,270
We may look silly, but underneath our cool
exterior we're fighting machines.

99
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:48,271
That's so!

100
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:48,970
Who are ya?

101
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,690
I'm Pankagumon!

102
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,830
I'm Reggepalmon!

103
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,970
Yeah!

104
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,810
What a couple of weirdos!

105
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,910
You're perfect!

106
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,590
I'll take ya!

107
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,090
Yeah!

108
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,690
Cool!

109
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,750
Come in.

110
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,650
My Otismon, I have some good news to
report.

111
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,010
The soldiers are assembled and we're ready
to move out!

112
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,450
Are they worthy of me?

113
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,890
Yes, my master!

114
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,270
They're a bunch of helpless sea slugs if
you want my opinion.

115
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,710
Who are you?

116
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,390
Greetings, little blue one.

117
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,730
Gah!

118
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,360
Gah!

119
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,361
Gah!

120
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Gah!

121
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Gah!

122
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Gah!

123
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Gah!

124
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,860
I've got time on him.

125
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,680
Have you done what I've asked of you?

126
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,280
Yes!

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,918
Per your instructions, I
searched everywhere and

128
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,300
found the most ferocious
Digimon I could find.

129
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
You'll be very pleased.

130
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,120
I knew I could trust you, Gatoman.

131
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,740
I look forward to meeting them.

132
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Thanks!

133
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,320
What is it?

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,780
We've prepared the room and it's ready for
your inspection.

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,040
Fine, the two of you are dismissed.

136
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,041
Right!

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
You

138
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,240
don't mind my asking, sir, what is this
room for?

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,100
Legends tell of this hollowed gate.

140
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,360
It is the passageway that will take us
forward to the other world.

141
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,661
When we pass through this porthole, we'll
be free to infiltrate the human realm.

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,333
According to my information,
the gate to the other

143
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,920
world should be
somewhere inside this castle.

144
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,815
My theory is that Myotismon
sent Demi Devamon to

145
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:05,341
distract us while he stayed
behind to prepare the gate.

146
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,480
Truly an ingenious plan on his part.

147
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
A good theory indeed.

148
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,440
Agumon and Palmon have certainly been gone
a long time.

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,640
It's not that I'm worried, it's just
that...

150
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,240
Well, I hope they're looking for the
location of the gate.

151
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
I'm wilting!

152
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
I want to get out of here now!

153
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,980
Now hop like Bunnymon!

154
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,180
Come on!

155
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,740
Come on!

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,640
Get the jelly out of your legs!

157
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,060
I want you grunts to be tough!

158
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,220
This battle's gonna be big, so get with
it, you worthless warts!

159
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,340
You gotta try like you never tried before!

160
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,580
We've tried we never tried before!

161
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,400
Oh, why should we start now?

162
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,860
Listen up!

163
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,220
Everybody that mouths off will go without
dinner tonight!

164
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,820
You do understand me, don't you?

165
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Oh, well...

166
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,480
But it's the only reason we joined the
Storky Army in the first place!

167
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,200
I'd like to soak in a hot tub for about
two months!

169
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,160
I've got blisters on my blisters!

170
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,320
I think we have to stop this guy,
and I know how to do it!

171
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,700
Yeah?

172
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,740
I was a soldier with him before,
he likes to drink soda, but the bubbles go

173
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:16,220
right to his head and make him as dipsy as
a Toodlemon!

174
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,880
He gets real kooky and he'll do anything
he want!

175
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,140
Even let us escape?

176
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
I must be exhausted!

177
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,400
Why?

178
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,620
I thought I saw a little pink thing pop up
and talk to us!

179
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,380
His stomach will fill with bubbles!

180
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,660
Yeah, he's sure to explode!

181
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,780
But if it explodes, won't he make us hang
around and clean it up?

182
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
You're nutsy!

183
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,440
Forget the mess, we can all escape!

184
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,840
One of us should go and get some soda,
he won't miss one of us!

185
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,760
That might work!

186
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,040
After that slob wouldn't
let us have dinner, I'll

187
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,222
open the bottles and pour
them down his throat myself!

188
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,360
Next up, contact sports!

189
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
How about wrestling?

190
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,440
You're the ball!

191
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:53,840
Yeah!

192
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,940
I wonder where... There it is!

193
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Oh!

194
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,840
This is what he gets for not feeding us!

195
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,400
You guys are so pathetic, don't tell me
you're all tired!

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,480
You're a worthless pack of goons!

197
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:13,980
What?

198
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,800
What in the world?

199
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,100
Oh, boy!

200
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,400
Me likes orange!

201
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,580
Oh!

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Delicious!

203
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,640
Have some more!

204
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Oh!

205
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Hey, anybody wanna go dancing?

206
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,320
I'm wide on my feet!

207
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Oh!

208
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,680
Go!

209
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,660
Go!

210
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,080
Go!

211
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,100
Yeah!

212
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:50,620
Oh!

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,580
I love that soda!

214
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,920
It worked!

215
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Yeah!

216
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,040
Let's get out of here!

217
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,300
Before he wakes up!

218
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,620
Yeah!

219
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,820
Bubble Fizz won't last forever!

220
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
I'm worried!

221
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Just be patient!

222
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,380
Hey, Luke!

223
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:14,940
They're back!

224
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,440
Sorry!

225
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,200
We had a big bruiser on our hands!

226
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Let's go!

227
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,140
My signal is useless inside the castle,
so you are on your own!

228
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,340
I'm counting on you!

229
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
We got it covered!

230
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,740
I hope so!

231
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,500
You must stop Myotismon from carrying out
his plans and protect your friend in Japan!

232
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,880
We better move him!

233
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,100
I must find the secret to the gate!

234
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,860
Once I understand the meaning of these
cards, the key will open the lock!

235
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,360
Then I will be able to enter the path to
the human world!

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
You digi-destined think
you're so smart, but

237
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:49,701
in reality I am always
one step ahead of you!

238
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
I've got

239
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,160
a real funny feeling about this,
you guys!

240
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,660
Think something's wrong?

241
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,840
Something just doesn't feel right!

242
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Oh!

243
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,500
Making any progress, Joe?

244
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,380
No.

245
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,660
This lock's ancient, but I still can't
break it.

246
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,780
Maybe if we had the key it would open.

247
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,040
Yeah, and maybe if we had a cannon we
could blast our way in.

248
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
It's no use!

249
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,980
Maybe there's another way in!

250
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
Let's check!

251
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,340
Joe, let's go!

252
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,340
How come I never get to be the hero?

253
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Hmm... Something's
totally weird here.

254
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
What?

255
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,620
We've passed this way before!

256
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Is that you, Ty?

257
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,200
Yeah, I'm up here!

258
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,360
Have you found anything unusual down
there, Izzy?

259
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, you could say that, Ty!

260
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,160
The truth is, you're way down there and
we're up here!

261
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,360
I think you guys may need glasses!

262
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,900
We're way up here above you!

263
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,360
But there's no way!

264
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,180
That's scientifically impossible!

265
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,380
I'm ready to proceed!

266
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,280
Go now and tell our forces that no sacrifice
is too great in this moment of glory!

267
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Right!

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,840
There's certainly no need to tell them
that they won't be sharing in the rewards!

269
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,760
I hold all the cards, and they are no
longer a mystery now!

270
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:25,680
All I need is to find that digi-destined
eighth child!

271
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,508
My theory is my Otisman
has set up these optical

272
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,820
illusions to deter us
from finding the gate!

273
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,520
Well, I'd say he succeeded!

274
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
We're still as lost as we were before we
started!

275
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:40,180
All we've done so far is go round and round
in circles and we don't know up from down!

276
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,580
It's making me dizzy!

277
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,020
Huh?

278
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
What's up?

279
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Someone's coming!

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You sure?

281
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
You doubt me?

282
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
Huh?

283
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,900
I'm itching to bite!

284
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,300
Why?

285
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Cause you're not pleased?

286
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,440
They seem to know where they're going!

287
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,360
Maybe we should try to follow them!

288
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,980
They'll lead us to the right place!

289
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,070
I shall now be embarking on a journey to
another world!

290
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,630
There are forces which must be neutralized
before our victory here can be complete!

291
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,510
But never fear!

292
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,230
I shall return in triumph!

293
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,000
It's time to stand back and watch me work
my magic!

294
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,400
Open the gate to my destiny!

295
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,790
You're not going anywhere!

296
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,610
Not as long as we can help it!

297
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,550
What is your name?

298
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,850
Do you work for me?

299
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,350
Can't you see I'm busy at the moment?

300
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,550
Yeah!

301
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,230
Right!

302
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:16,990
Demi-devi-mon, would you please take care
of this annoying gang of hoodlums?

303
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,550
I have better things to do!

304
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,350
Of course, sir!

305
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,510
Anything you want!

306
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,550
I'm at your service!

307
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,950
I'm not letting you get past this gate!

308
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,910
Bad chance, you little twerp!

309
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,490
I brought reinforcements!

310
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,510
It's all yours, Nanamon!

311
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,030
Right!

312
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,410
Don't even think about passing by me!

313
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,290
You got it?

314
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,990
Farewell, Digi-doomed!

315
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:37,690
Okay!

316
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,050
Let's fight!

317
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,310
Yeah!

318
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,450
We don't want to fight, you guys,
but the future is at stake!

319
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,850
You'll have to forgive us!

320
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,910
Digimon!

321
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,670
Digimon!

322
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,390
Digimon!

323
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:48,890
Abumon!

324
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,810
Digibob to...

325
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,430
Raymon!

326
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,330
Kabumon!

327
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,570
Kabumon!

328
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,511
Digibob to... Wongumon!

329
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,830
Kantumon!

330
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,470
Digibob to...

331
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Kabuterimon!

332
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,250
Gobamon, Digivolve too?

333
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,290
Ikakumon!

334
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,600
Back in your ranks!

335
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,680
Come on, I'll buy you dinner!

336
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,680
Too late now, we're going for some fast
food!

337
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,260
Y-y-you're big!

338
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,060
Anybody need a wrestling coach?

339
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,160
You can't resign!

340
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,726
You want to bet, Pipsqueak,
when it comes down

341
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,720
to having my fanny
kicked, I'm out of here.

342
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,260
And if you don't believe me, you might
check the fine print of my contract.

343
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,900
We're coming through!

344
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,120
Don't let me stand in your way!

345
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,340
You might as well give up!

346
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm outnumbered!

347
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,840
Could help us so hard to find!

348
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,280
Just admit you picked the wrong side and
give it a rest already!

349
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,740
If you're trying to frighten me,
it won't work!

350
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,780
You haven't dealt with me!

351
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,010
That was two!

352
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,340
To the gate, everyone!

353
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:44,100
We've got to get
through, Digimon!

354
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,220
He's one nasty dragon guarding the gate.

355
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Debbie doesn't like losing.

356
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,580
If you want a real surprise, look into his
eyes.

357
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,980
He'll be hypnotized!

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,100
Nova Brun!

359
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,520
Howling Luster!

360
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
It'll be a joke!

361
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,080
Farpoon Torpedo!

362
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,820
Had enough Needlespring!

363
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,620
I'm starting to feel really weird.

364
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,640
What's happening?

365
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,420
Come

366
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,420
on!

367
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
What's happening?

368
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,660
C'mon, we have to make a run for it while
we have the chance.

369
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,540
Ready, get set, go!

370
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,680
Go through it!

371
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,210
Digimon!

372
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:21,930
Digimon!

373
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,090
Digimon monsters!

374
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,810
Digimon are the Junkers!

375
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,950
Digimon are the Junkers!

376
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,610
Braymo!

377
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,530
Digimon tools!

378
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,630
A little Braymo!

379
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,910
A little Braymo!

380
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,040
It's a dreamer!

381
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,860
Champions of this is over her!

382
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,630
Champions of this is over her!

383
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,670
He did it!

384
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,970
It's clear sailing from here!

385
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,190
C'mon, everybody!

386
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,510
Let's get through that gate!

387
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,400
Get ready to jump!

388
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,100
Hurry!

389
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,480
The gates are closing!

390
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Goodbye!

391
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,100
It can't be!
