1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
So we wound up back at camp where this
whole adventure started.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,560
We had to find the 8th Digi-Destined before
Myotismon could sink his fangs into him.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,720
It wouldn't be easy, because we were still
miles away from the city.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
We got there only to find Mammothmon
destroying everything.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,320
Garudamon took care of that hairy
elephant.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,200
That's when we remember that all of us saw
two Digimon fighting years ago.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,184
Izzy figured that's why we
were the Digi-Destined, and

8
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,840
that the 8th child must have
seen the Digimon before, too.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,700
Let's hope we find the kid before
Myotismon does.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,190
Digimon!

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,230
Digital Monsters!

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,550
Digimon are the champions!

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,050
Digimon!

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,170
Digital Monsters!

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,530
Digimon are the champions!

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:56,610
Change into Digital Champions to save the
Digital World!

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,970
Digimon!

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,190
Digital Monsters!

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,530
Digimon are the champions!

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,990
Digimon!

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,170
Digital Monsters!

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,530
Digimon are the champions!

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,450
Digimon!

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,180
Digital Monsters!

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,500
Digimon are the champions!

26
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,620
Digimon are the champions.

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,040
Digimon, digital monsters.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,600
Digimon are the champions.

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,700
Digimon, digital...

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,130
So you're telling me Garudamon has
appeared in the real world?

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:30,790
Right.

32
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,270
And the seven children have returned to
the real world as well, Master.

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,250
And?

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,470
The eighth child has not been found yet?

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,550
Eh, no, malignant one.

36
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,410
Not quite yet, but any minute now.

37
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,650
Guaranteed.

38
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,250
We're, uh, widening the search pattern
even as we speak.

39
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,251
He's alive.

40
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,230
If the kid's anywhere to be found,
we'll find him.

41
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,730
We're looking everywhere.

42
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,750
Air, land, and sea.

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,530
We gotta cover no problem.

44
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,650
Meanwhile, we are not the only ones
looking for him, are we?

45
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,670
You don't.

46
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,890
Make sure that those children don't find
him first.

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,090
Got it, Master.

48
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,870
Can we get a snack before we go looking?

49
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,050
There's no time.

50
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,250
We've got to get to Odaiba and find that
eighth kid before somebody else does.

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,430
How will we get there?

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,951
Do you think there are any fast food
places along the way?

53
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,010
Would you knock it off about the food?

54
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,050
Anyway, we've only got enough money for
our subway tickets.

55
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,090
Subway?

56
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,830
Oh well, my parents won't let me ride the
subway by myself.

57
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,210
You're not by yourself.

58
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,950
Now come on.

59
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,870
Are subways like regular trains?

60
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,570
I mean, do they have snack cars?

61
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,950
Just drop it and stick together,
everybody.

62
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,890
It can get kind of confusing down here.

63
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,790
I just hope my Otis Mon has as much
trouble reading this map as I do.

64
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,770
Okay, what do we do now besides starve to
death?

65
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,710
I'm just figuring it out.

66
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,190
Okay, that'll work.

67
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,686
Now, the fastest route to
Odaiba is to take the number

68
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:01,310
12 train to Nagano and
transfer to the Maranucci Line.

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,750
Then transfer to the Ginza Line and get
off at Shinbashi.

70
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,570
Huh?

71
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,910
Sounds simple enough.

72
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,050
Now we just have to figure out the right
fare.

73
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,390
What's that, Ty?

74
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,570
What are you getting?

75
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,630
A ticket.

76
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,410
You can't ride the train without one.

77
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,350
What's a ticket?

78
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,130
What's a train?

79
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,530
Shh!

80
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,910
Come on, guys.

81
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,810
Not another word out of you from now on,
okay?

82
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,702
We don't want anybody seeing
you and then asking a bunch

83
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,130
of questions that we don't
want to explain the answer to.

84
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,390
Yeah, while we're here, you've got to
pretend to be toys or stuffed animals.

85
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,810
But remember to keep still and no
fidgeting.

86
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,310
Here's an idea.

87
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,330
I'll be one of those dolls you told me
about.

88
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,210
The kind where you squeeze them and they
go, wah, wah, wah, wah!

89
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,590
Be a doll that doesn't talk.

90
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,750
It's some kind of cave.

91
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,610
I don't like being underground.

92
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,270
Hey, put a lid on it.

93
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,350
Attention, attention.

94
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,750
Number 12 train now arriving at Platform
7.

95
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:54,930
What?

96
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,610
Where'd that voice come from?

97
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,630
You heard it?

98
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,570
Then it's not just inside my head.

99
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,070
Something's coming!

100
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,610
Look at those glowing eyes!

101
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,350
It's one of my Otispawn's goons!

102
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,850
Hey!

103
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,450
Watch out!

104
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,970
Ah!

105
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,970
Ah!

106
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,410
Ah!

107
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,710
Ah!

108
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,930
Ah!

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,680
We can't take you guys anywhere.

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,320
Hush!

111
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,040
Come on!

112
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Here, take my seat.

113
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Oh!

114
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Thank you!

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
Wasn't that nice of a girl?

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,240
We've been on our feet all day,
haven't we?

117
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Ah!

118
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,040
Ah!

119
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
Ah!

120
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
Ah!

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,180
No!

122
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
No!

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,540
No!

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,060
No, no, honey!

125
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,740
Let go now!

126
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
That's the girl's toy!

127
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,640
Come on!

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Honey!

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,140
Ow!

130
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
That's gotta hurt!

131
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,820
Oh, come on, honey!

132
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,940
Let go of the girl's toy before you break
it!

133
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Honey!

134
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,230
I guess my toy didn't like when you pulled
on him.

135
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,210
You hear that?

136
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,050
That stuffed animal talked!

137
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,170
Ha!

138
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,890
It worked!

139
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,790
All that practice is paying off!

140
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,090
Fooled him, didn't we?

141
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,630
Hush!

142
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,190
Just keep quiet and play along!

143
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,730
Come on!

144
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,390
The baby pulled your hair because he likes
you, that's all!

145
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,370
Oh, really?

146
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,910
There's no reason to bite the poor thing's
head off!

147
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,690
Oh!

148
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,270
I'm very sorry I shouted!

149
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,550
See that, son?

150
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,810
She's just making it look like the doll is
talking.

151
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,070
It's called ventriloquism!

152
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,210
She's pretty good!

153
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,470
Whoa!

154
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
Whoa!

155
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,330
Actually, that was the doll talking!

156
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,970
I want one!

157
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:07,550
Huh?

158
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,930
Daddy, give me that toy!

159
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,890
I want that doll!

160
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,170
Huh?

161
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,530
If I don't get one right now, I'll start
screaming at the top of my bones!

162
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,690
Excuse me, young lady, can I ask where you
bought that doll?

163
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,770
I need one right away!

164
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,450
Uh, where I bought it?

165
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,230
It's not that hard a question,
is it?

166
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,370
Come on, you'll be doing me a big favor.

167
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,570
Where did you find it?

168
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,570
This stop is Nerima.

169
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,150
Please watch your step.

170
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,210
Again, this stop is Nerima.

171
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Whoa!

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,760
The Nerima Department Store!

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,800
What?

174
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,280
Nerima?

175
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,220
Thanks a lot!

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,120
Come on, son!

177
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Oh!

178
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
Thanks again!

179
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
Bye-bye!

180
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,160
Wow, that was a close one.

181
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,700
Pretty weird how nuts that kid went over
Yokomon.

182
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,641
If we don't find the eighth child,
we could go into the... Toy business?

183
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,080
How much longer?

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,760
Oh no, someone wake me when we get there!

185
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
Yeah, me too.

186
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,980
What's the name of the stop where we're
getting off again?

187
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,980
We get off in Nagano.

188
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,060
Okay.

189
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,061
Nagano.

190
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,620
This stop is Nagano.

191
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,060
Please watch your step.

192
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,040
Again, this stop is Nagano.

193
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Hey!

194
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Here's our stop!

195
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,620
Look!

196
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,800
We're supposed to be quiet!

197
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,280
Shinjuku, this stop.

198
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
The end of the line.

199
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,300
Last stop, Shinjuku.

200
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Please exit.

201
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Huh?

202
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
What?

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,620
How'd we miss our stop?

204
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,600
All of you slept right through it.

205
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,260
Padamont, you were awake?

206
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Sure.

207
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,620
What's wrong with you?

208
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Why didn't you wake us up?

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
How could I?

210
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,700
You told us not to make a sound.

211
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,540
Oh!

212
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,900
What now?

213
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
Go back to our stop?

214
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,820
No.

215
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,780
It's out of our way.

216
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,920
But I think we can change trains here and
be okay.

217
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,240
How much longer?

218
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,140
I'm getting awful hungry, Ty!

219
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,400
Yeah, I'm starving!

220
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:35,401
Famished!

221
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
It can wait.

222
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
Hey, I'm hungry too, you know.

223
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,000
I keep visualizing cheeseburgers!

224
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,260
And I don't even eat cheeseburgers!

225
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,120
It has been a long time since any of us
have eaten.

226
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,980
And our Digimon get weak when they're
hungry.

227
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,230
Okay.

228
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,810
This place is a zoo and not a restaurant
in sight.

229
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,090
The first one to see some place to eat,
give a shout, okay?

230
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,210
Huh?

231
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,190
Dad, can I get some ice cream?

232
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,110
Oh, uh, hey Izzy!

233
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,950
What is it?

234
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,690
You see something?

235
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,970
The other guys.

236
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,750
They're gone!

237
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,430
What?

238
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,050
What?

239
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,910
I can't believe this!

240
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,050
They ditched us!

241
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,310
Oh!

242
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,990
Okay, okay, don't panic.

243
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,650
As long as we have this, we can always
find them.

244
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,050
Huh?

245
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:24,910
That's funny.

246
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,730
Why isn't it working?

247
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,150
You think something might have happened to
it when we came back to the real world?

248
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,930
All I know is this is one of those days
when everything goes wrong.

249
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,290
Come on!

250
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,530
Let's hurry.

251
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,570
Freeze it!

252
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,050
Apples!

253
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,470
Ow!

254
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,790
Ah!

255
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,050
Bad dog!

256
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,190
Bad dog!

257
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,550
Huh?

258
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,630
Huh?

259
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,590
Look!

260
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,930
They're eating without us!

261
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,280
I feel like a new woman!

262
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,620
Man!

263
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Tastes great!

264
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Yum-alicious!

265
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,740
Boy, I sure needed this!

266
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,740
You people are lucky!

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,800
Yum-yum!

268
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,880
You get to eat this stuff every day!

269
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,420
A little louder, why don't you?

270
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,460
There's a couple of people that aren't
staring yet.

271
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,940
Actually, nobody noticed yet, but Matt's
right!

272
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
You should...

273
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,540
Oh!

274
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,540
Uh-oh!

275
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,320
Joe, Izzy!

276
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,321
Well, it's about time!

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,780
Hey!

278
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,260
What are you guys waiting for?

279
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
Order something!

280
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,040
How?

281
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,380
When you guys have got all the money,
huh?

282
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,400
Whoops!

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
We went and spent it all!

284
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,820
See?

285
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,080
We were all so hungry, we ordered the
super-duper combos!

286
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,140
Great!

287
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
You spent it all?

288
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,140
That was all the money we had in the
world!

289
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,240
All the dumb, greedy, selfish little
things, it's unbelievable!

290
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,656
These guys are supposed to be my friends!

291
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:00,920
My friends!

292
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,360
My friends!

293
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,840
My friends!

294
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:02,841
Look at that!

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,820
Now the digivice is responding!

296
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,420
So, why wouldn't it be?

297
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, it wasn't working at all when I
tried it in the station!

298
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,760
Really?

299
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,280
I guess in this world they only function
at a close distance.

300
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,600
That's great!

301
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,660
But meanwhile, what are we going to do
now?

302
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
We start walking!

303
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,300
They won't let us back on the train
without any money!

304
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,980
I'm sure not looking forward to walking
all that way!

305
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,880
Ha!

306
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,920
I know a way that won't cost us a penny!

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,740
Just leave everything to me!

308
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,660
Oh, great!

309
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
You're a genius!

310
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,700
Help!

311
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,080
Police!

312
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,960
My cat is stuck in a tree in Odaiba!

313
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,440
And I've gotta get there right away so I
can get her down!

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:36,980
Hey!

315
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,660
The police?

316
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,200
That's his brilliant idea?

317
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,420
If the police do stop, they'll lock him up
for disturbing the peace!

318
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,780
Hey!

319
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,040
I've got the right of way!

320
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Looking good, Ty!

321
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
Good grief!

322
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,816
At this rate, we could be sitting here all
day!

323
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,360
And night!

324
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,000
Then you try to get us a ride!

325
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,460
Me?

326
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,100
No way!

327
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,920
How about you, Matt?

328
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,080
You think you're so smart!

329
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,240
Hm.

330
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Whoa!

331
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
Well?

332
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm waiting!

333
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,940
Not so easy, is it, Matt?

334
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,140
Well, at least my cat's not stuck in a
tree!

335
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,210
Taxi!

336
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:22,850
Taxi!

337
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:23,310
No taxi!

338
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:23,850
No taxi!

339
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,310
No taxi!

340
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:24,690
No taxi!

341
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:25,691
No taxi!

342
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,020
No taxi!

343
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:31,220
No taxi!

344
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:32,221
You kids want a cab?

345
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Yeah!

346
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
You got any money?

347
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
No.

348
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,640
So?

349
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
It's my cousin!

350
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,160
Hi, Wade!

351
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,740
Need a lift?

352
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah!

353
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Yay!

354
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,980
All right!

355
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,470
Her cousin?

356
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,010
What are the odds of that happening?

357
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,090
One in 4.2 million... Whatever!

358
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,770
I'm just glad we have a ride!

359
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,930
Excuse me, but what's a cousin?

360
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,210
Skip it.

361
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,890
Okay, here's the rules.

362
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,490
I'm gonna say this once, so listen.

363
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:10,790
Yeah?

364
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,750
Dig it!

365
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,050
You're only here cause Sora is my cousin.

366
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,410
You're like your luggage.

367
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,030
Yeah.

368
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,630
We're like your luggage.

369
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,130
And luggage doesn't make a sound.

370
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,810
You got me?

371
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,570
Or else it's liable to get itself thrown
out of the car, right?

372
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,190
Right.

373
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,330
Luggage doesn't make a sound.

374
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,830
You want some gum?

375
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,470
Sugarless?

376
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,630
Uh, sure.

377
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,770
How about you, Sora?

378
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,870
Thanks, Dwayne.

379
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,410
Uh-oh!

380
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,310
Hey, Sora.

381
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,170
I think your cousin's a major ramo.

382
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,130
He's sort of the black sheep of the family,
but he's giving us a lift, so be nice.

383
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,450
I will, but just make sure he takes us to
Odaiba.

384
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,500
Do you like it?

385
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Mm-hmm.

386
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,480
How did I ever get into this?

387
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,660
Knocking myself out searching for some
pipsqueak kid.

388
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,860
I got half a mind to chuck this whole
lousy job.

389
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,900
But the master might not like that.

390
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,310
The radio's kinda loud!

391
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,630
The tunes are kinda what?

392
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,610
The radio?

393
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,590
Still loud?

394
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,850
Maybe just a little!

395
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,930
Now for a news update.

396
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,290
Officials have yet to find a clear
explanation for the devastating explosion

397
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,758
that rocked the
Heightened View Terrace

398
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,750
apartments in the Norema
District earlier today.

399
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,732
Power in the area is
still out, and the injured

400
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,070
are still being counted
after the bizarre incident.

401
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,978
While official sources have
offered no further information,

402
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:57,210
there are reports of
several eyewitness accounts.

403
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,290
However, these accounts have only served
to further mystify investigators.

404
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,310
The details of their accounts differ,
but several of these eyewitnesses agree

405
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:08,910
that an elephant and something described as
a giant firebird were seen in the vicinity.

406
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:09,570
A giant what?

407
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,770
Firebird?

408
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,030
You gotta love the crazies in this town.

409
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:14,918
A similar incident took
place at the Heightened

410
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,830
View Terrace
apartments four years ago.

411
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,910
It's unknown whether there is any
connection between the two.

412
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,590
What's the matter?

413
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,610
What's the matter?

414
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,090
Stop the guard!

415
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,670
Whoa!

416
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,890
What is that?

417
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,150
Coromon, you couldn't wait?

418
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,850
Okay, who did it?

419
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,370
Huh?

420
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:35,371
Huh?

421
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,050
Which one of you made a mess of my new
seat covers?

422
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,150
I'm sorry, I... Right here, I'm the one!

423
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,530
I'll clean it up, I'll even detail it for
you.

424
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,950
Don't try covering up for these losers!

425
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,270
Which one of them was it?

426
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,950
You, Mr. Peepers!

427
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,130
It was you, wasn't it?

428
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,470
Hey, let him go, he didn't...

429
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,810
Izzy, no!

430
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,210
Ah!

431
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,211
Izzy!

432
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,710
Nah, I'm coming, is he?

433
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,930
Digimon!

434
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,710
Digimon!

435
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,570
Digimon!

436
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,230
Digilo monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

437
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,690
Digimon!

438
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,170
Digilo monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

439
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,490
Muddy-man!

440
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,690
Digimon!

441
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,010
Tinko-man!

442
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,410
Ah, Izzy!

443
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,690
Thanks, Tato!

444
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,970
Ugh, you had to have that extra side of
chili fries, didn't you?

445
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,150
Hey, watch that!

446
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,550
You are... Yeah?

447
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,670
It's Ges-O-man!

448
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,270
It's what?

449
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,650
Ges-O-man!

450
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,050
Take a bit of everything nasty that lives
under water, stick them together,

451
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,970
and that's him!

452
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,490
Ah!

453
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,030
You get to run your own!

454
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,590
Good riddance, you're a lousy driver
anyway!

455
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,970
Digimon!

456
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,710
Digimon!

457
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,510
Digimon!

458
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,130
Digilo monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

459
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,670
Digimon!

460
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,130
Digilo monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

461
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,250
Go-O-man!

462
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,490
Digimon!

463
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,630
Digimon!

464
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,290
Digimon!

465
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,010
Digimon!

466
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:16,531
I think we'll just get out of the way!

467
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,930
Oh!

468
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,910
Coral Crosher!

469
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,970
Oracle Torpedo!

470
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,350
Holy cow!

471
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,210
What's going on?

472
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,710
They must be advertising something!

473
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,350
Advertising something?

474
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,270
Get out of here!

475
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,030
Maybe they're shooting a movie.

476
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,430
I don't see any cameras.

477
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,310
Oh well, maybe they're just rehearsing.

478
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,290
And so then you know what he said?

479
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,830
Oh, what's that?

480
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,410
What's going on over there?

481
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,510
Rough day at work, huh?

482
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,370
Uh, you know, same old set.

483
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,590
My money's on the big hairy one!

484
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Bad!

485
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,320
Man, did you guys see that?

486
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,340
Zora?

487
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
Hey Zora!

488
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,380
Where'd all those kids go?

489
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,600
Well, so much for keeping a low profile.

490
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,960
At least we got away from lame Dwayne and
we're all in one piece.

491
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
Nice work, Ikakumon.

492
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,220
You nailed him!

493
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,727
Anyway, wouldn't
you rather travel in the

494
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,860
fresh air than under the
ground in that subway?

495
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,020
Oh yeah, this is great!

496
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,360
And best of all, it's free!

497
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
Here's good news!

498
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,000
Now that they've shown themselves,
we can finally take care of them!

499
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,660
Next up, home!

500
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Yeah!

501
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Good home!

502
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,180
Does anybody have something to eat?

503
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,180
Oh, Mimi, not that again.

504
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:05,260
I was just asking!

505
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,620
I was just asking!
