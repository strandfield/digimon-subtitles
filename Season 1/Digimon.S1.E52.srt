1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,100
It's sad to think that someone can be so
depressed it takes over their entire life.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,852
For Matt, these feelings of
dread took the form of a deep

3
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:09,041
black cave, and he was
about to be lost in it forever.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Gabamon finally opened Matt's eyes,
and proved that he was really loved.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,238
Sora had a similar problem,
but Matt and Joe were

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,621
able to pull her out of
her own cave of darkness.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,913
Tai and Ward Raymon had
been holding off Piedmon all

8
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:22,121
on their own, and they
were completely exhausted.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,860
With the power from Matt's crest of
friendship, they became re-energized,

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,920
and should be able to take care of that
laughing fool once and for all.

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:54,790
a diesem Celia reallyプroject to die.

12
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,760
Now that we have two Mega Digimon,
let's destroy Piedmon once and for all.

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,280
Go get him, Metal-Gururumon.

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,680
Come on, War-Greymon, take care of this
clown!

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,680
So... I'm a clown.

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,100
Then I'll act like one clown trick!

17
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,660
I'll get him!

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,540
Try jumping through this hoop!

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,020
Are you okay?

20
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,920
Why don't you join us?

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,240
We're having a ball.

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,960
Oh, sorry if I call to a balance.

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,760
Round and round he goes.

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,740
Where he lands, nobody knows.

25
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,100
He thinks this is just a big game.

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,760
Well, I'm tired of playing around.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,040
Let's not be hasty.

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,340
He wants us to make a mistake.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,500
What's the matter?

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,500
Don't want to play with Uncle Piedmon
anymore?

31
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:11,560
No!

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Trumpsword!

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,960
Be careful of the swords!

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
Hey, wait!

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,640
Some of those swords aren't real!

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,580
War-Greymon, I'm picking up the real
swords on my sensors!

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,440
Over to your right!

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Cover me!

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,140
That's old wolf's snout!

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,900
Looks like the joke's on you, Piedmon!

41
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:35,460
Terra Force!

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
All right!

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,200
Nice shot!

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
Izzy, have everyone digivolve and attack!

45
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,480
You heard him, guys!

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
Now it's our turn!

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm in!

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Me too!

49
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Caution!

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,280
A white flag?

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,620
Maybe he's trying to surrender to us.

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't trust him.

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,880
I think he's got another trick up his
sleeve.

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Hey, why don't you make yourself
disappear?

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,740
Playtime is over!

56
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,560
But I'm just getting started!

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,180
War-Greymon!

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,300
Metal-Gururumon!

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
What happened?

60
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,180
I don't know!

61
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Ta-da!

62
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,620
Thanks for coming next shows at 7.30!

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,800
You've been a great crowd!

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,300
Good night!

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,840
He made them all disappear!

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,916
Well, at least he didn't saw them in half.

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,780
What did you do to tie and met,
Piedmon?

68
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,380
I hold the keys to their existence.

69
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,260
And I need a place to put them,
so I made a couple of keychains.

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,160
I think I'll hang these two on my
backpack.

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,040
What kind of sicko turns people into
keychains?

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm not a sicko.

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,900
I'm a collector and these new items have
such sentimental value to me.

74
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,960
Now, who wants to be next?

75
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,760
Look at all this fire!

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,340
This is terrible!

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,880
I didn't bring a single marshmallow.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,800
Sentaruman, I came as fast as I could.

79
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,801
Oh, Jedi!

80
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm glad you made it!

81
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,040
Is this it?

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,520
Yes, this is the mystical wall of fire the
ancient prophecy on File Island describes.

83
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,140
Really?

84
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,420
What do you say we barbecue?

85
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,260
Incredible!

86
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,280
Is it really true that he had to make it
across these flames?

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,140
I know it sounds crazy, Jedi, but that's
what the prophecy says!

88
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,140
Unbelievable!

89
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,260
Oh!

90
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Oh!

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,060
Oh!

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh!

93
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:38,521
Oh!

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh!

95
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Oh!

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Oh!

97
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,600
Oh!

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Oh!

99
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Oh!

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,160
Oh!

101
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,020
Oh!

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Oh!

103
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,560
Oh!

104
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,360
Oh!

105
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,100
Oh!

106
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Oh!

107
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
Oh!

108
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,180
Andromon!

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
We've got to get out of here, Sora!

110
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,180
Andromon's buying us more time!

111
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
It

112
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,820
looks like a giant circus tent.

113
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,620
Whatever it is, I don't like it.

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,180
Hey, there's a way out across this canyon!

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,660
My only question is, how do we get to it?

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
The only way is to use these swings like a
trapeze artist, but don't let down,

117
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
there's no net!

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,400
Kari, hold me tight and don't let go!

119
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,560
Not so easy to fly, is it?

120
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,680
What are you carrying in that backpack?

121
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Bricks?

122
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,720
Ow!

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,820
Gatomon, you've got to trim your claws!

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,680
Away you go!

125
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Don't you want to take your friend along?

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,120
Andromon!

127
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Go, Izzy!

128
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
Joe!

129
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,620
Don't worry, Izzy!

130
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I'll save you!

131
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,000
Now you see them, and now you don't!

132
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,420
They're dropping like flies!

133
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,380
Really?

134
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,200
That's strange!

135
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,520
I feel fresh as a daisy!

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
Mimi, get up here!

137
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,180
It looks like the battle's started!

138
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Thanks!

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,640
Oh, it's just my luck!

140
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,100
I finally bring all the reinforcements and
all they want to do is hang around!

141
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,940
Hello, my name is Izzy and I'm very smart!

142
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,380
Although I didn't know how to stop me and
my friends from being made into kitchens!

143
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,770
I love a good puppet show!

144
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,530
Ah,

145
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,670
so you want to play hide and go seek,
hmm?

146
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,150
Okay!

147
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,070
I love a good game!

148
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,770
Now, let's see, if I were a little pest,
where would I hide, hmm?

149
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,290
Maybe you're in this room, over here!

150
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,330
I think we're out of danger for now!

151
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:09,950
Ah!

152
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,770
Kick-a-boo!

153
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,030
Ah!

154
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,110
Run for it!

155
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,510
On the
on-the-on-the-on-the-on-the-on-the-in!

156
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,950
Celestial Arrow!

157
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,570
Run, Cory!

158
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,890
Hurry, Sora!

159
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:25,570
It's Anjumumon!

160
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,690
Garudumon!

161
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
We're back!

162
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,820
TK, come here.

163
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,720
What is it?

164
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,140
I want you to take Kari and get out of
here.

165
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,300
Well, what about you?

166
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Listen to me.

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
There isn't much time.

168
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Paimon has the rest of our friends,
and if he gets us, we're doomed.

169
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,900
TK, please.

170
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,860
You're the only one who can protect Kari.

171
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,140
You have to be brave.

172
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,040
Now get going.

173
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,380
I won't leave you.

174
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,120
Don't worry about me.

175
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
I'll be fine.

176
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,060
All right.

177
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,400
No matter what happens, just keep running.

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,860
Okay, Sora.

179
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,360
I promise I'll do whatever I can to
protect Kari.

180
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,800
Right.

181
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,600
Hurry, go!

182
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,400
Come on, Kari.

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Let's go.

184
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,800
Sora, I want to stay and fight with you.

185
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Don't be ridiculous.

186
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,600
You can't even Digiball without Joe.

187
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,420
So go before Paimon gets here.

188
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
But, Sora!

189
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,460
Go, Momon.

190
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,180
Joe risked his neck to protect us.

191
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,300
And if Paimon turns you into a doll,
his sacrifice will mean nothing.

192
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,220
Now, please help TK and Kari.

193
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,480
There's not much time.

194
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,481
Ow.

195
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Now go!

196
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,676
Look, I only need five
more keychains for my

197
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,880
collection, and then
I'll have the whole set.

198
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Not if I can help it!

199
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
Sora!

200
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
TK, catch!

201
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,300
In order to succeed, sometimes you have to
step on people along the way.

202
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,860
Oh, man!

203
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Quick, let's run!

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,820
We just ran out of room.

205
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,360
This isn't the escape plan I had in mind.

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,280
No way!

207
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,000
Can we jump?

208
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
It's too far!

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,900
Welcome to the dead end!

210
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
Don't be a keychain like your friend.

211
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,660
We can't just sit here.

212
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
We've got no choice.

213
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
We have to climb down.

214
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,140
It's too high, TK.

215
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,680
If we slip, we're goners.

216
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,820
Kari, we're going to have to try.

217
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,260
Look, TK, where'd that basket come from?

218
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Who put that there?

219
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
A rope!

220
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,100
We can use it to climb down the side of
the mountain.

221
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,320
I didn't know you were a sick charmer,
TK.

222
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,820
Do you think we should climb it?

223
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
I don't know.

224
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,300
Mom always said never take candy or rope
from a tree.

225
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm strangers.

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
What am I thinking?

227
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
We have to climb it.

228
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,220
Sora told me to be brave no matter how
scared I get.

229
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,400
Looks dangerous.

230
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
You go first.

231
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Oh.

232
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,900
That's it, Kari.

233
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,140
Pretend you're in gym class.

234
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Listen!

235
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Open!

236
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,310
I must quit this.

237
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,950
It costs me a fortune in new doors.

238
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,790
Keep climbing.

239
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,990
I'll distract him.

240
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,050
Digimon!

241
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,530
Anjumon!

242
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,550
Digimon!

243
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,370
Digimon!

244
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,610
Ah!

245
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,230
Ah!

246
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,030
Ah!

247
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,650
Ah!

248
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,810
You get him, Anjumon!

249
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,630
No!

250
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,170
No!

251
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,190
No!

252
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,430
No!

253
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,510
Drop everything!

254
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,790
Don't give up!

255
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,250
No!

256
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,930
I'm scared.

257
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,430
It's okay.

258
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,050
Great.

259
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,330
Wait, now Kari's afraid.

260
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,070
I can't let her see that I am too.

261
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,490
I've got to be brave.

262
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,390
Anjumon will be fine, but you've got to
keep on climbing.

263
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,450
Don't let that Joker Piedemont scare you.

264
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,630
Okay.

265
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,150
You've reached the end of your rope!

266
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,930
TK!

267
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,870
No!

268
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,850
Sorry if I gave you a reggie.

269
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,550
Let go of him!

270
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,590
Let go, Kari, or he'll get you too!

271
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,910
No, I won't let you go, TK!

272
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,650
Sounds like you two are falling,
Burichella!

273
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,490
TK!

274
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,491
Hurry!

275
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,150
TK, don't ever give up.

276
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,210
Matt?

277
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,770
You can do it, TK.

278
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,770
I have faith in you.

279
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,090
But it won't help if you don't have faith
in yourself.

280
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,450
No matter what happens, you have to fight
to the very end.

281
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,250
I promise you, Matt, I'll never give up
the fight.

282
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,150
If I don't do it, then this world and our
world will be destroyed.

283
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,710
I have to do it for Matt, for Anjumon,
for everybody.

284
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,030
TK?

285
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,910
TK!

286
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,510
I am Magna Anjaman.

287
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,130
I have eight shining wings and a beam
shield.

288
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,390
I wield the mighty sword Excalibur.

289
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,790
And my devastating attack is the Gate of
Destiny.

290
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,330
Chew on this!

291
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,710
I'm not hungry.

292
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,010
I guess my sword trumps yours.

293
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,340
Now to bring our friends back to normal.

294
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,060
Magna Antidote.

295
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:23,190
What a weird dream.

296
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,890
I had an incredible urge to carry some
keys.

297
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,050
Car, TK!

298
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,450
You did a great job, TK.

299
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,350
If it wasn't for your advice, I don't
think I would have been able to do it.

300
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:35,790
Huh?

301
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,930
Wow, when did Anjaman teach evolve?

302
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,750
You look great.

303
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,890
Turn around, let me see.

304
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,570
Very well.

305
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:40,810
Oh!

306
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,790
So, those Diddy Destin think the Dark
Masters are that easily defeated, hmm?

307
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,410
Well, guess again.

308
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,450
You're not the only ones with an army of
friends that can help you.

309
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,870
Ta-da!

310
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,470
This is more fun than a barrel of flying
monkeys.

311
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,850
Diddy Destins, meet the Vilemon.

312
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,550
Their nightmare shock will give you a rude
awakening.

313
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,150
We're surrounded.

314
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,430
Oh no!

315
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,550
We can't escape!

316
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,430
Come on!

317
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,030
Toughen up!

318
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,850
I'm with you, TK.

319
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,110
Our only chance is if we all combine our
powers together.

320
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,730
But the problem is we're still missing
some of our friends.

321
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,690
Wait for me!

322
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,010
Sorry, we're late!

323
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,510
It's Mimi!

324
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,370
Are we too late for the party?

325
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,570
Come on!

326
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,650
I sliced!

327
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,890
I guess I'm gonna have to work on my
swing, huh?

328
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,970
All right, gang!

329
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,530
Give them the full Digimon attack!

330
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,930
Super Thunderstrike!

331
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,130
Hornblaster!

332
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,710
Nice shot!

333
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,990
Purple Whack!

334
00:15:47,130 --> 00:16:10,640
Car the Junkers!

335
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Zulomon!

336
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,730
Most Impressive!

337
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,170
Twinshot!

338
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,970
Hornbuster!

339
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,770
Yay!

340
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:50,830
Flower!

341
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,870
Gate of Destiny!

342
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,530
Remember us?

343
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,430
Terra Force!

344
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,510
Gigamissile!

345
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,850
The last remnants of Spyro Mountain are
disappearing!

346
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,990
The Dark Master's control over the digital
world is finally gone!

347
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,910
Good riddance!

348
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,630
Bye, friends!

349
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,690
Goodbye!

350
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,570
Goodbye!

351
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,110
Goodbye!

352
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,826
You know, I'm starting to think we have a
strange-looking group of friends.

353
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,143
They might not have
the best fashion sense,

354
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,631
but they're the best
friends we've ever had!

355
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,030
Hm.

356
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,450
We have email from Jedi.

357
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,010
What's it say, Izzy?

358
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,390
Not now.

359
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,510
I need a nap.

360
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,570
It's coming in now.

361
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,170
Is he congratulating us?

362
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,030
Jedi says here that the Dark Masters
aren't the real enemies.

363
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:33,670
Huh?

364
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,920
It says here that the real
enemy is an evil force whose very

365
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:39,690
existence warped the Digi-World
and created the Dark Masters.

366
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,050
So according to this, I don't think we're
out of the woods quite yet.

367
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,210
Wait a sec.

368
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,830
If it's not the Dark Masters, then who do
we fight next?

369
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,030
