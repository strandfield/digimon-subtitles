00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,888
Datamon knew Sora
wouldn't help him fight


00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:05,160
Edamon, so he created
an exact double of her.


00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,460
We staged a great plan to break into the
pyramid and rescue her.


00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,060
A plan so good, it actually worked.


00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,740
Datamon opened a hole to the center of the
power network and was sucked in.


00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,820
Along with Edamon and everything else.


00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,200
Edamon soon returned for a big showdown.


00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,714
Using the power of my
tag and crest, Greymon


00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:24,501
digivolged into MetalGreymon
and defeated him.


00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,440
Unfortunately, we were caught in the
vortex.


00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,320
There's no telling what strange world
we'll land in.


00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,440
Digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,620
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:59,060
Change into digital champions to save the
digital world!


00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,100
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,240
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!


00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,980
Digimon and the champions.


00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,970
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions.


00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,570
When we defeated Edamon, something very
strange happened.


00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,850
No way!


00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,150
What happened?


00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,310
We must have been
pulled through some sort of


00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,550
dimensional opening
between DigiWorld and this one.


00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,790
Wherever this one is.


00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,590
I bet that opening's the same way I got to
DigiWorld.


00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:45,890
But where are we now?


00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,530
They look like human beings and this looks
like Earth.


00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,710
But is it really?


00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,010
I don't know.


00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,470
I've never been here before.


00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,970
This can't be.


00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,130
This looks like a park I played in as a
kid.


00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,610
I think we're in my hometown.


00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,990
No way!


00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,290
Yeah, that's the toy factory.


00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,750
And that's City Hall over there.


00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,390
Ty, I don't mean to cut the
sightseeing tour short, but


00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,730
have you noticed that I'm
not Metal Graemon anymore?


00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,890
I'm back to Koromon.


00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,270
Unbelievable.


00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,530
This can't be real.


00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,531
It feels real to... Oh!


00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,710
Huh?


00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,450
Hey!


00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,150
Huh?


00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,350
Tell me something.


00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,270
Where are we?


00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,550
Is this world for real or am I imagining
it?


00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,810
What?


00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,290
We just want to know if you're a real
human being.


00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,390
Please tell us, are you a real girl or a
digital girl?


00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,810
What'd I do?


00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,510
Did I say something wrong to her?


00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,310
You scared her.


00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,670
Now she's going to tell the park police.


00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,190
Ah!


00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,910
The police!


00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,030
Will they arrest me for making her cry?


00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,130
Save me, Ty!


00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,190
They're gonna get me!


00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,610
Be quiet!


00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,370
Listen up.


00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,970
Just pretend you're a soccer ball.


00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,290
Now let's get out of here so I can chill
and figure out what's going on.


00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,970
This all looks so familiar, Koromon.


00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,450
This has to be my home.


00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,410
Well, for your sake, I hope so.


00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,230
But how can you be certain that you're not
just imagining it in the digi world,


00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:01,570
Ty?


00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,650
Well, I guess we'll find out when we go to
my house and see.


00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,630
Hey, did you hear what I just said?


00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,350
Until we go to my house.


00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,950
Oh, wow, Koromon!


00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,130
This has got to be the happiest day in my
life!


00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:12,810
I'm home!


00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,390
I'm home!


00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,470
I'm home!


00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,710
It's true!


00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,270
I'm home!


00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,170
This is so cool!


00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,270
I'm finally home!


00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,846
I can't wait to see my family,
and when they get a look at you,


00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,910
they'll know I'm telling the truth about
digi world.


00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,830
Then we'll see if the others got home,
too, and hook up with them.


00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,770
Mmm!


00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,870
I hope you're right!


00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's go!


00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,470
It's a good thing I still had some of my
camp money left.


00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,770
The subway's a lot nicer than walking
home.


00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,220
Wow!


00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,560
Everything looks exactly the way it did on
the day I left for camp.


00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,980
That's where I live, Koromon!


00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,420
Pretty neat, don't you think?


00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
All those rooms?


00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
Your family's big!


00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,140
It's an apartment building.


00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,480
Lots of families live there.


00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,180
I don't know what to expect.


00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
Everything's been so weird.


00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,860
Being in digi world, I've lost track of
time.


00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,020
I wonder if they're even going to
recognize me.


00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,500
We won't know unless we go in!


00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,600
Right.


00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
Well, here goes.


00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
It's unlocked!


00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,660
They must be home.


00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,540
I remember when my mom planted those
flowers.


00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,223
I remember buzzing my
friends up on that intercom


00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,021
to come over and play
video games and watch TV.


00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,540
Oh, and the time when my dad put our
family nameplate on this door.


00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,300
But those memories won't mean a thing,
Koromon.


00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,300
If we came out of that dimension rift at
the wrong time, what if I no longer exist?


00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:34,760
Ty, can I make a little suggestion?


00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,660
Huh.


00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,100
Open the door.


00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,040
Here we go.


00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
Hello?


00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,360
Look, the shoes are here.


00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,060
Mom?


00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Dad?


00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,900
No one's answering.


00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,180
Maybe they're out.


00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
I wonder where they've gone.


00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,020
Maybe they went to Digi World.


00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
That's not funny.


00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,320
Hey, Ty, over here.


00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
I'm thirsty.


00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,700
Sorry, it's the last one.


00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:03,940
What?


00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,860
You should've asked for some before I
finished drinking.


00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,460
I can't believe he'd be so stingy!


00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,560
I was just joking, Cry Baby.


00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,020
Really?


00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,400
I left you half of it.


00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,680
I sure wish I knew where my family was.


00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,340
And how long I've been gone.


00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,720
Huh?


00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,220
Aha!


00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
Don't scare me like that!


00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,260
It's been right in front of me.


00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,820
Today's August 1st, the same day we landed
at Digi World.


00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,200
We've gone back in time?


00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:30,620
Yeah!


00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,231
This is the day the
Digivices dropped into our


00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,520
hands, and this whole
crazy adventure began.


00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,800
Which reminds me that this is also the day
my mom and dad were planning to visit my


00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:41,880
grandmother, who lives just outside of the
city.


00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,540
See?


00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,520
My mom marked the date on this calendar so
she wouldn't forget.


00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,160
They must've taken my little sister,
Kari, with them.


00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
That's why nobody's home now.


00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,500
Cool!


00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,140
Then let's just kick back and wait for
them to come home.


00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,900
Speaking of time, it's time to eat.


00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,300
Hold your Digi horses!


00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,020
I've just learned I'm reliving a day I've
already lived!


00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Sorry, Ty.


00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,020
No, I'm sorry, Koromon.


00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,060
I didn't mean to yell, but this same hour,
minute, and second have already occurred.


00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
Except I'm home this time.


00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,120
Does that mean I have a twin living in
some parallel world?


00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
What was that?


00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,240
Huh?


00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Hear that?


00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Hi, Ty.


00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,080
Kari?


00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
You're here?


00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,100
Mom and Dad left you here at home all
alone?


00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm a big girl.


00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Hi, Koromon.


00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,680
Kari?


00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,880
How did you know his name?


00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:32,580
Maybe she knows my name because your
sister's a lot smarter than you.


00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Cut it out, Koromon!


00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,580
I'm serious!


00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,580
Now, how did you know his name was
Koromon?


00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,460
I don't know.


00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
I just knew it.


00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,440
I don't get it!


00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,280
It's like I've met him before.


00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,440
That's why I'm not afraid.


00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
But that's impossible.


00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,260
This is the first time he's ever been out
of Digi World.


00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,920
Well, maybe that's where we met.


00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,480
But you've never been to Digi World,
have you?


00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I don't know.


00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,180
I think so.


00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
It's near your camp.


00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,420
Maybe Kari has been to Digi World.


00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,420
She did have on that camp whistle.


00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,265
Maybe she goes to my camp
in the future and is sucked


00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:04,140
into Digi World like I was,
but comes back before me.


00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,600
Oh, I don't know.


00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:09,600
This moving back and forth from one time
dimension to another is mega-whacked.


00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,280
No one's ever sure whether they're here or
now or there and then.


00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,620
Sometimes I feel more like I'm where and
when rather than here or there.


00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
What did I just say?


00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm confusing myself.


00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,120
I know.


00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,040
Maybe Kari and I have a fever and we're
both delirious.


00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
What's wrong, Ty?


00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,840
Nothing.


00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,760
Then why do you think I have a fever?


00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,320
Huh?


00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,980
I'm not sick.


00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
And I've been to Digi World.


00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
No way.


00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,980
Well, I think you have.


00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,220
Where else could you find a Koromon?


00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
The toy store?


00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, please.


00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
You do know.


00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,480
I'd better call everyone else's house to
see if they got home, too.


00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,340
Hi.


00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,580
Is Izzy there, please?


00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,020
Summer camp?


00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,640
Oh.


00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,780
This is Ty.


00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,960
I came home from, uh, camp early.


00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,060
And I just wanted to see if Izzy did,
too.


00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
No, everything's just fine.


00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
Thanks.


00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,860
So you haven't heard from Sora since she
left for summer camp?


00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,000
Thank you.


00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,980
Matt hasn't called home or anything?


00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,300
Okay.


00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Thank you.


00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,860
It looks like I'm the only one who got
pulled through that rift.


00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,260
Everybody else is still stuck in Digi
World.


00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,000
I wish Izzy were here.


00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,960
He could get this Digivice to work.


00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,840
Then I could go back to Digi World and
rescue the others.


00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,900
There's just gotta be a way to fix this
time dimension thing.


00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,880
Ty.


00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,660
Huh?


00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
I know you're hungry.


00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
There's food in the fridge or you can have
my leftover piece of pie.


00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,280
I get first dibs this time!


00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,660
I've got a better idea.


00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,420
I'll make us a healthy breakfast.


00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,270
Come and get it!


00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,390
It's good to be home.


00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,391
It's good to be home.


00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,130
Delish!


00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,131
You said it!


00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:57,970
Nom nom nom!


00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,190
Ty, you never cooked.


00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,390
Did you learn a camp?


00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,230
What?


00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,050
Yeah.


00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,690
My new friend Matt taught me when our
summer camp switched to Digi World.


00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,010
You're good.


00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,150
I'm stuffed.


00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,630
You guys can eat the rest.


00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,790
Glad to!


00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,050
Nom nom nom nom nom!


00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,670
Whoa!


00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,370
Man, I am so full I won't have to eat for
at least a year.


00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,550
Oh boy!


00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,980
What's wrong?


00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
So full!


00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,640
I'd better go rest.


00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,900
Don't hide in the bathroom.


00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,900
How embarrassing!


00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,281
Why do you want to hang out with someone
who's such a pig?


00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
Cause you're cute.


00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:39,860
Really?


00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,540
Yeah.


00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,456
Do you want to hear what happened to me at
school?


00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,060
We took a farm field trip and I slipped
and fell in a pig pen.


00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,260
The kids were laughing at me till Ty
jumped in.


00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,260
Know what he did?


00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,080
He played in the mud with me like I'd
really done it on purpose.


00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,020
Wow!


00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:55,760
Ty does bug me sometimes, but he is the
coolest big brother in the world.


00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah.


00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,870
I'm really back.


00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,230
I used to hate that wind chime.


00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,710
Now I love it.


00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,950
And I really miss sitting around watching
TV with my friends.


00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,930
I miss mom scolding dad for not hanging up
his shirts.


00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,130
Boy, it's good to be home.


00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:22,131
Oh.


00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,870
Unbelievable weather conditions around the
world have all weather experts puzzled.


00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,010
There is still no rainfall in Southeast
Asia and all the rice paddies are drying


00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,190
up as a result of a record setting
drought.


00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,111
In the Middle East, major flooding continues
to wreak havoc for a concerned populace.


00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,770
Meanwhile in America, snow falls and a
freak midsummer cold spell.


00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:43,290
What?


00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,950
What is Frigimon doing here?


00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,510
Could somebody please tell me what's going
on here?


00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,530
The Digimon are clearly on the TV screen,
but the reporter hasn't mentioned them.


00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,410
Finally!


00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,030
Somebody else can see them.


00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:54,710
Huh?


00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,090
Are you saying you can see the monsters
too?


00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,790
For a long time now.


00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,410
Mom and Dad don't believe me.


00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,650
They just think that I watch too many
scary movies.


00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:03,651
Kari!


00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,970
Uh-oh.


00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,390
Hey, what's going on?


00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,490
My Digivice has activated itself.


00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,710
Huh?


00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,370
What's wrong with the computer,
Ty?


00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,350
There's a face!


00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,530
Huh?


00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,770
Can you hear me?


00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,150
Izzy?


00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,610
Wait!


00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,510
Danger!


00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,050
Izzy?


00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,090
They... no... it isn't!


00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,890
Ty, wherever you may be, don't come back
here!


00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,790
I can't just leave you guys there,
Izzy.


00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,750
I have to come back.


00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,030
I could be your only chance.


00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,031
Digimonsters!


00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,250
Total chaos!


00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:35,930
Wait!


00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,710
Izzy!


00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,230
I need help with the Digivice!


00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,650
You're better off where you are!


00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,970
Don't come back!


00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,530
Izzy!


00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:43,531
Izzy!


00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,740
While we're here safe at home,
my friends are in trouble.


00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
What now?


00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,740
I don't know, Coromon.


00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,380
I just don't know.


00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,560
Two worlds are in danger and I can't do a
thing about it.


00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,280
I feel totally useless.


00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,671
I know this Digivice is powerful
enough to do something,


00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,081
but I don't have a clue
on how to make it work.


00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,100
Oh man, I guess I should just quit while
I'm ahead.


00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,020
But Ty, you can't!


00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Why can't I?


00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,020
What am I gonna do?


00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,960
Throw the Digivice at the monsters and
hope they get scared and run away?


00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,721
Oh... Come on, Ty.


00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,000
Just relax.


00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Eat some watermelon.


00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Cori's right.


00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,340
I do need to relax and chill out.


00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,980
Maybe an idea of what to do will come to
me.


00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
I hope.


00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,680
Boy oh boy, if there's one thing I duly
love, I duly love this watermelon!


00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
It's sweet, huh?


00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,320
You can eat all you want, Coromon.


00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,060
Wow!


00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I need another slice!


00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,600
This roll is great!


00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,300
I'm glad you like it here on Earth.


00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,840
Because you may be staying here for a
while.


00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,841
Huh?


00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,620
You may not be returning to DigiWorld any
time soon.


00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
If at all.


00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,100
But you are more than welcome to live with
us forever.


00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,780
Hmm.


00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,780
It didn't hit me until just now.


00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,480
I may never get back to my home.


00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,250
Telephone!


00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,251
Who is it?


00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,710
Mm-hmm.


00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:33,670
Mm-hmm.


00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,850
I'll see you, Mom.


00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,690
Let me hear!


00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,810
We might be a little later than planned.


00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:40,233
There's supposed to be a
storm coming in, and there


00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:42,730
might be some heavy
traffic coming back into town.


00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,590
Oh, and your grandparents want you and Ty
to come visit when you get well.


00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,030
Kari?


00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,190
Are you listening?


00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:50,670
Kari?


00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:52,050
Are you still there, honey?


00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,850
Mom?


00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:53,710
What?


00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,230
Ty?


00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,510
What's happening, Ty?


00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,190
Now I understand.


00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,310
Earth is in just as much danger as the
DigiWorld.


00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,710
How?


00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,730
DigiWorld's troubles are slipping through
the dimension.


00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:07,850
What can we do?


00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,890
There's nothing we can do until I figure
out how to use the DigiVice so we can


00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:14,390
return to DigiWorld and fight the bad
Digimon.


00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,410
But we'll be okay for now, Koromon.


00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,870
This'll be a nice break.


00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,402
Here we have all kinds
of food and candy and


00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:22,530
stuff, and we get to
sleep in a soft bed.


00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,850
We'll be living large.


00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,390
Right.


00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,810
Sorry, DigiBud.


00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,390
Look, there's lots of things to do out
there.


00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,410
That satellite dish is more in touch with
the world than we are.


00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:34,530
We could go to the beach, the movies,
take Kari shopping.


00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,590
Yeah.


00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,130
What am I talking about?


00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,608
My friends are in danger
because I can't make this piece


00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,890
of techno junk work and
I can't do a thing about it!


00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,490
What's that?


00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,970
Earthquake!


00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,110
What?


00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,430
Is it Seedramon again?


00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Oh no!


00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,840
Tyrannomon!


00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
What's he gonna do?


00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
No!


00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,500
Ty?


00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
What about me and Kari?


00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She stays here!


00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,720
Kari, don't leave for any reason!


00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,120
Koromon and I have to find that
dimensional rift!


00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,660
We gotta find a way back to DigiWorld!


00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
No!


00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Oh...


00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Huh?


00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,840
What?


00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,560
What happened?


00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
He's gone!


00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Huh?


00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,680
It's Dromojomon!


00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,019
Apparently some of our viewers
have called into our station


00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,500
claiming to have seen
monsters on our newscast screen.


00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
There he is!


00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
No way!


00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,540
Maybe this is a dream!


00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Back to news!


00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,160
Authorities believe this is merely a bit
of hysteria among a few individuals.


00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,640
If you think you see these monsters, you
should seek medical attention immediately.


00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,090
The Digimon are drifting
back and forth between


00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,020
both worlds through
that dimensional rift!


00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,063
We have to find it and
get through it before


00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,220
those monsters destroy
Earth and DigiWorld!


00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,560
It'll take all of us working together to
stop them!


00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,880
We've got to get back!


00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,920
Even if we did, I can't help you!


00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,780
In spite of all I've eaten, I can't seem
to Digivolve, so I can't fight!


00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,380
I just get in the way!


00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,000
I need you, Koromon!


00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,460
We can't win unless we fight as a team!


00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,800
Don't you give up now!


00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,940
Ty!


00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,880
Koromon!


00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,860
Wait for me!


00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I wanna go with you!


00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,260
Huh?


00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,220
Kari, I told you not to leave home!


00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,240
You can't go with us!


00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,060
It's too dangerous!


00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,100
Please, Ty!


00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Oh, please!


00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,000
Please!


00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:34,720
Huh?


00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,840
Ogremon!


00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,600
Ty!


00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,220
Kari!


00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,320
It's Ogremon!


00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,520
Huh?


00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,860
But the people don't seem to notice him!


00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
What's he doing?


00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,100
He's just standing there waiting for the
light to change!


00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,460
Maybe if we wait, he'll disappear like the
others!


00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,180
Are you okay?


00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,880
Koromon?


00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,380
Huh?


00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,940
Koromon, where are you?


00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,240
He's up there!


00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,540
What?


00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,620
He's trying to fight that monster
single-handed!


00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,780
Bubble, pull!


00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Whoa!


00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,800
Whoa!


00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,480
Whoa!


00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,220
Whoa!


00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,460
Koromon, digivolve!


00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,320
I can't do it unless you use the digivice!


00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,676
I don't know what's wrong, but the
digivice isn't working!


00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,220
You'll have to digivolve without it!


00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
I just can't!


00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,160
You can do it, Koromon!


00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,161
Ah!


00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Koromon!


00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Digivolve!


00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Digimon!


00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,080
Digimon!


00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Digimon!


00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,800
Digimon!


00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,740
Digimon!


00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Digimon!


00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Digimon!


00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,680
The dimensional rift's opening up like a
mega vacuum cleaner!


00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Koromon, help!


00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,100
Koromon!


00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Digivolve!


00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Ogumon!


00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,120
Hurry, Ogumon!


00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,121
Ah!


00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
I made it!


00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
In DigiWorld!


00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,020
I'll never forget you, my friends!


00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,080
Thanks for your help!


00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,480
Wait!


00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Take me with you!


00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,100
You still need my help!


00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,920
Ogumon!


00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,360
Ty!


00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Stay with me!


00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,460
No!


00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
Go wait for Mom and Dad!


00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm so sorry!


00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,580
Why?


00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,400
You're right.


00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,160
I know you have to leave.


00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I really do.


00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Okay?


00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Okay.


00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,320
Agumon can't Digivolve without me.


00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,020
This is my fight, too!


00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,220
Please be careful.


00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,520
It was really hard to watch Kari as I
floated away.


00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,900
But there was no way I could have taken
her with me.


00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,560
I knew it was way too risky.


00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,820
Besides, Mom would have been really mad at
me if I had.


00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:35,840
But what I didn't know is that Kari would
soon find her own way to DigiWorld.


00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,710
Agumon, we're back in business.


00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,230
Now we've got to decide what our first
move is.


00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,890
Well, we have to find our friends.


00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,190
Then we have to make sure you and the
others get home safely.


00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,730
Not until we conquer all the evil Digimon.


00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:55,690
Otherwise, neither one of our worlds will
ever be safe.


00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,910
Well right now your enemy is responsible
for." It's a process done yet.


00:19:58,911 --> 00:19:59,010
It is a process, but also takes our minds
in the Bible sent it silent.


00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,070
You're going without any other problems,
brook.


00:19:59,071 --> 00:19:59,550
You can't do everything, brook.уж��.


00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,551
OK, because
