1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
As we floated there in the middle of the
ocean, we thought we were done for.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,378
That's when, out of
nowhere, Waymon rushed in to

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,780
whisk us all off to the
safety of the Briny Deep.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,700
But our battle with the Dark Masters was
far from over.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,560
They sent the Divermon after us,
and soon they were hot on our tail.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,420
We led them on a deep sea chase, but
the pressure was just too much for them.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,940
When we finally came up for air,
we thought we had made it to safety.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,795
But as bad luck would
have it, Metal Seedramon

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,380
had followed us, and
he had other ideas.

10
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm tired of playing around with you,
War Greymon.

11
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,100
Say goodbye!

12
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,320
River of Power!

13
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,710
So much for your impenetrable chrome
digizoid armor.

14
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,030
Looks to me like it got a little rusty.

15
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,559
Next time you decide
you want to rule the waters,

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,890
do everybody a favor and
take a bubble bath instead.

17
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,790
We won!

18
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,990
DigiDestin, please, save this one.

19
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,970
Oh my god!

20
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,170
Waymon!

21
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,450
Where did he go?

22
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,410
Everyone!

23
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,760
It's happening to Metal Seedramon,
too!

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,400
They're floating in the sky!

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,100
I know where they're going!

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,700
Spiral Mountains Peak!

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,900
No, that's the real reason for all the
shaking!

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,640
Over there!

29
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Huh?

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
The ocean!

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,760
It's, uh... disappearing!

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,103
You don't.

33
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:18,650
..

34
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:20,290
see that every day!

35
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,830
Tag, I'm it!

36
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,150
Metal Seedramon out!

37
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,290
Puppetmon in!

38
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,970
Spiral Mountains Ocean is almost
completely gone!

39
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,930
But why?

40
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,990
The Digital Ocean is being reconfigured
because we kicked its Dark Master's butt!

41
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,170
Quite interesting, but does this affect
us?

42
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,850
Absolutely!

43
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,190
It changes everything.

44
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,270
If we're gonna get any surfing in,
we better hurry!

45
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,150
Those wimpy Dark Masters are no threat to
Super Joe!

46
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,690
That's the DigiToot I like to hear from
you humans!

47
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,310
Alright!

48
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,130
Let's go!

49
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:55,630
Yeah!

50
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,330
Wait!

51
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,330
Huh?

52
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,310
We're not through here yet!

53
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,310
Mimi!

54
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,910
What are you doing?

55
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,890
In case you haven't noticed, some of our
friends are gone!

56
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,310
Oh!

57
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,330
Sorry!

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,670
That one is to remember Wizardmon!

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,010
The one next to it is for Pixiemon!

60
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,570
That one's Chumon!

61
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,930
And this one here is for Waymon!

62
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,210
Mimi, they're not dead!

63
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,891
It's more like they've been downloaded to
a different computer!

64
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,890
That's right!

65
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,170
We're digital!

66
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,530
Our information just gets reconfigured!

67
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,950
What better reason do we need to get the
Dark Masters?

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,030
Payback for making our friends leave!

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,150
I'm not going!

70
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,450
Huh?

71
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,330
What are you saying?

72
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,850
I have had enough!

73
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,010
Every time we fight we wind up losing
another friend!

74
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,370
This is war, Mimi!

75
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,450
And sometimes people we like get hurt,
so deal with it!

76
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,610
Stop it, Ty!

77
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,490
Enough!

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,670
Why don't you stop and think about other
people's feelings for a change?

79
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,190
Huh?

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,430
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,510
We all know you're right, Ty, but just
give us a little space!

82
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,870
Huh?

83
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,650
We miss our friends who fought alongside
of us!

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,570
Not everyone has ice running through their
veins like you do!

85
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,310
What?

86
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,810
Calm down!

87
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,990
You're so busy looking forward that you
never take time to look back!

88
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,890
We've lost some good friends here, Ty, and
it's nice to remember them once in a while!

89
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,370
If we always stop to do that, we'll never
have enough time to save the world!

90
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,371
You still don't get it!

91
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,390
I know you hear me, but you're not
listening!

92
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,810
Stop it!

93
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,070
You're making everyone upset!

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,650
You two are supposed to be friends!

95
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,850
Don't cry, Mimi!

96
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,830
Where are sitting ducks out here?

97
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,990
Let's find some place a little less out in
the open!

98
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,570
I'm not as cold as Matt thinks,
am I?

99
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,830
Maybe I was a little too rough on Ty,
but he's gotta respect our feelings!

100
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,690
I've never seen Matt so upset before!

101
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,950
This is terrible!

102
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,570
We should be concentrating on fighting our
enemies, not each other!

103
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,110
I just know they're all thinking about me!

104
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,470
That's why no one's talking!

105
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,670
Everyone's so tired and cranky!

106
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,110
You okay?

107
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,230
Walk?

108
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,850
Hmm...

109
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,210
Why'd you stop, Kari?

110
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,250
Did you hear a noise just now?

111
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
What kind of noise?

112
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,830
You mean you didn't hear someone speaking
a second ago?

113
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,970
You mean a voice?

114
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,230
No, I didn't hear anything at all.

115
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,450
Weird.

116
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,670
Come on, let's get back to the others.

117
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,990
There's safety in numbers.

118
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,310
Hmm.

119
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,490
Where were you two?

120
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,790
I thought I heard something, but it was
just my imagination.

121
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,170
It's dangerous out here, so stay with the
group.

122
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,390
Okay, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,090
If these kids take any longer to get here,
I will develop wood rods!

124
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,990
Have patience, Rome wasn't built in a day.

125
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,230
Yeah, but I was, and I'm tired of waiting!

126
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,790
Huh?

127
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,630
What's this?

128
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,030
Why are the trees running so fast?

129
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,030
What is going on?

130
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,590
Things aren't moving faster!

131
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,310
We are!

132
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,270
The ground we're standing on is
accelerating!

133
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,150
This is more fun than the time I was
fumigated for termites!

134
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:55,670
Wee-hee!

135
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,910
Woo-hoo!

136
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,810
Now where did I put those dogs?

137
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,750
I haven't seen some of these toys since I
was a sapling.

138
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,110
We've got to jump off!

139
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,290
Now this part's moving!

140
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,490
Obviously, someone's trying to get us
somewhere and in a big hurry.

141
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,410
I bet you're right.

142
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,890
And why do I get the feeling that
someone's not too friendly?

143
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,650
No, no!

144
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,150
This is the first time I've been carsick
without a car!

145
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,350
I've got a plan.

146
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,970
This was always good for a few laughs.

147
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,250
Master!

148
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,510
Yes, that's very entertaining, Lord Puppetmon,
but there's no sign of the children.

149
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,730
What?

150
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,170
They were here a second ago!

151
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,650
Where are they?

152
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,790
Not here!

153
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,510
Not here!

154
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,110
I need our new cable company!

155
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,020
I have a hunch that one of the dark
masters is behind all this.

156
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,940
I'll bet you're right.

157
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,960
We have to do something.

158
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,260
I say we either keep going or fill the
nest.

159
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,420
Well, I say we have to fight whoever it is
sooner or later, so let's get to it!

160
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,920
Oh, come on!

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Again with the fighting?

162
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,400
Why don't you just go to a neutral corner
already?

163
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,240
Come on, Matt!

164
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Please stop arguing!

165
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
You, keep out of this!

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,820
All right, Matt.

167
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,180
Let's try it your way.

168
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,560
We'll stay up here and wait for the enemy
to get us!

169
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
That's not what I meant!

170
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Stop it, Matt!

171
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,400
Where'd Ty go?

172
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,940
He disappeared!

173
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,840
Oh, did he fall?

174
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,580
Oh, no!

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,780
He vanished into thin air!

176
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,480
Look!

177
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,700
Now Mimi's gone!

178
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Mimi, come back!

179
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,600
Maybe their screensavers are on sleep!

180
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,700
Joe!

181
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,220
Hurry!

182
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,200
Everybody's disappeared but us!

183
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,240
Ah!

184
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
What's going on?

185
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Oh!

186
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,960
Huh?

187
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Huh?

188
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,880
How'd we get over here?

189
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,980
We've been transported.

190
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Whoa!

191
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,640
I hate mud!

192
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Ah, come on!

193
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
I think it's over!

194
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,680
But now we're separated from everyone
else!

195
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,160
Don't worry!

196
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,401
We'll be all right without the others,
especially Ty!

197
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:45,960
Huh?

198
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,780
TK?

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,300
Yeah?

200
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Just stick close to me and I'll protect
you no matter what happens!

201
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Listen, Matt.

202
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,520
The only reason we got this far is because
we worked as a team.

203
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,680
Each one of us has played a part along the
way in keeping us together, including Ty!

204
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:04,860
But I... Uh... Uh... And I don't need
you to protect me all the time either!

205
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,360
If you haven't noticed, I've grown up a
lot!

206
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,640
I've fought alongside you guys since the
beginning and I've always held my own!

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,780
TK... That's not what I meant.

208
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,201
What I... What I wanted
to say was... What?

209
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm pushing everyone away.

210
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,150
One, two, three!

211
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,350
You're still in the tree!

212
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,830
You know, Kiwi Mom, this isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

213
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,210
I should just destroy them all!

214
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,350
Then you won't have anyone left to play
with.

215
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Good boy!

216
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,940
Hey, Joe!

217
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,880
Are you all right?

218
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
My stomach!

219
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,300
What's wrong?

220
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,980
Does it hurt?

221
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,540
No!

222
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm just doing this because it's fun!

223
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Joe!

224
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,020
I've got a new game I wanna play!

225
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,380
Come here!

226
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,260
Whoa!

227
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
You too!

228
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Whoa!

229
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,180
Oh, brother!

230
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,481
And for you... Whoa!

231
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,080
This is like playing chess with the Digi
Destin!

232
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,780
Corey!

233
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
No!

234
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Oh!

235
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,820
Whoa!

236
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Fascinating!

237
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,541
Maybe for you... Where am I?

238
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,340
We've reached the turning point!

239
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Impossible!

240
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Whoa!

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Whoa!

242
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,620
Whoa!

243
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Whoa!

244
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,440
Whoa!

245
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:33,900
Welcome back!

246
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,520
Goochie-goochie-curl!

247
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,100
Whoa!

248
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,100
Huh?

249
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,080
Huh?

250
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,200
I don't know what's so funny, but this is
no laughing method!

251
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,320
Huh?

252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Matt, you're back!

253
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
TK!

254
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,040
You know, I'm getting tired of doing
nothing!

255
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,040
I will be some cat stuck in a tree!

256
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,100
Let's go look for them!

257
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,780
Good idea!

258
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,420
I'll start by looking for TK!

259
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,180
Oh!

260
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
This is awful!

261
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,480
You said it!

262
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,780
How could it get any worse?

263
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:56,860
Look!

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
I'll tell you how!

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,400
The branches are starting to crack!

266
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,340
Wow!

267
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,660
They should learn to fly!

268
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,740
I think I found a new toy to play with!

269
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,880
He looks very easy to scare!

270
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,780
You want me to get him for you?

271
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,240
No!

272
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,840
I'll get this one myself!

273
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:10,880
Hm!

274
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Hm!

275
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,080
TK!

276
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,980
Are you alright?

277
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,100
I guess so, but I felt like something was
tickling me and I couldn't stop laughing!

278
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,300
I wonder if there's something wrong with
me?

279
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,360
Are you sure you're not hurt?

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:28,940
Hey!

281
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,580
Stop being so worried about me!

282
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,620
I told you before that I know how to take
care of myself!

283
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Okay!

284
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,800
Huh?

285
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
TK!

286
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,100
What do you say?

287
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,480
TK!

288
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Stay close!

289
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,260
Time to play!

290
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,660
Sounds like the voice is getting closer!

291
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,550
Keep your hands off my brother,
Puppetmon!

292
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,430
Or I'll chop you into firewood!

293
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,590
Aw, come on!

294
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,330
Be nice!

295
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,530
All I wanted to do was play a little game
of war with TK!

296
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:03,950
Play?

297
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,630
Play?

298
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,631
You mean like pretend?

299
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,730
But of course!

300
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,770
At least in the beginning it will be
make-believe anyway!

301
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,330
But then it's bye-bye!

302
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,630
And it will be time to destroy you for
real!

303
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,130
If I got rid of you now, I'd have no fun!

304
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,550
TK, he's just trying to scare you!

305
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,590
Don't listen to him!

306
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,310
Don't lie to him or your nose will grow!

307
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,410
Ah!

308
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,110
I can't move now!

309
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,150
Are you okay?

310
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,110
Matt!

311
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,111
What?

312
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,970
Now, shall we get going?

313
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,710
Forget it!

314
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,810
I don't want to!

315
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,750
Hmm... Well, if you don't
come with me, it's no fun!

316
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,890
Maybe instead I'll destroy your brother!

317
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,510
What do you say?

318
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,070
Okay, I'll come!

319
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,410
That's a good boy!

320
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,390
TK, it's a trap!

321
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,910
Run away now while you still can!

322
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,650
Shut up!

323
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,950
So, is it a deal?

324
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,490
We'll have lots of fun!

325
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,390
Now you hide and I'll seek and destroy!

326
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,750
That's good!

327
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,290
Keep running!

328
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,610
You make the game interesting!

329
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,310
Hey!

330
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,070
Someone's coming!

331
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,390
Who could it be?

332
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,070
Sounds to me like Lord Puppetmon has found
a new play toy!

333
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,230
Oh, hi there!

334
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,430
Bye!

335
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,930
Wait, I'm hiding back here, so don't say
anything, K!

336
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,130
No problem!

337
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,310
Hey, you guys!

338
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,626
You didn't happen to see a little kid run
back here, did ya?

339
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,090
He's got a green hat and a backpack!

340
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,410
No!

341
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,046
We didn't see anything like that,
boss!

342
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,570
All we saw was a kid wearing a backpack
and a green hat!

343
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,630
He's hiding over there!

344
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,730
Losers!

345
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,430
Come out!

346
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,830
Come out!

347
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,930
Wherever you are!

348
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,450
Especially if you're behind the door!

349
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,970
Aha!

350
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:36,830
Hey look!

351
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,550
A house in the middle of the forest!

352
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,650
I wonder if anyone inside has seen TK!

353
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,770
What's

354
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,470
going on around here?

355
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,770
K!

356
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,510
Matt!

357
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:03,890
TK!

358
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,410
TK was taken prisoner by Puppetmon!

359
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,310
Puppetmon?

360
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:07,930
Oh no!

361
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,250
We have to help him!

362
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,790
Where'd that creepy little toothpick take
TK?

363
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,030
I don't know!

364
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,070
Get a hold of yourself, Matt!

365
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,070
It shouldn't be that difficult to find
him!

366
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,190
I'm sure that first road we were on leads
directly to Puppetmon!

367
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,950
Then we'll all be trapped!

368
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,590
It's worth it to save TK!

369
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,270
I agree!

370
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,490
Let's go get him!

371
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,850
Who are you?

372
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:30,090
No one may interfere with Master
Puppetmon's playtime!

373
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,790
You're all staying right here!

374
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,550
Oh no!

375
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,410
It's Kiwimon!

376
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,970
An ancient Digimon that was said to be
extinct!

377
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,250
Although he's a bird-type Digimon, his
wings have degenerated so he can't fly!

378
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,690
Pummel pack!

379
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,281
Have some... Peppa Bread!

380
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Ah!

381
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,780
Ah!

382
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Final Twister!

383
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Electro Shocker!

384
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Ah!

385
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
Ah!

386
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Ah!

387
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,580
Hmm... What these dolls are for?

388
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:18,840
Ah!

389
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,020
This one looks like Joe!

390
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,000
Joe, what happened?

391
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,120
Why does this stuff always happen to me?

392
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,560
Weird!

393
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:24,820
What?

394
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,480
I didn't see anyone push you!

395
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Joe's on TV!

396
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,740
Let's see what else is on!

397
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Oh!

398
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Hmm!

399
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,980
Now that's what I call remote control!

400
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
Yoo-hoo!

401
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,060
There you are!

402
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
I found you!

403
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
The game's over!

404
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh!

405
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm gonna destroy you in a minute!

406
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,440
But first I have to smash my legs!

407
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,200
Hmm... I guess that's what I get
for having a leg made of poison oak!

408
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,600
I can outsmart him!

409
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,020
Hmm... How boring!

410
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm not having any fun at all!

411
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,600
What?

412
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,280
I'm the life of the party!

413
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,580
I put the fun in fungus!

414
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,300
Ha!

415
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,220
You just play the same game over and over
again!

416
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Boring!

417
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,760
I've got friends!

418
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,380
Yeah?

419
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Then how come I haven't met these
so-called friends of yours?

420
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,540
All right!

421
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,780
I'll get them and introduce you right now!

422
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
TK!

423
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Panamon!

424
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,800
I like to make friends!

425
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,050
Hey!

426
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,550
Where are you keeping TK?

427
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,990
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

428
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,730
Answer me!

429
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,730
I know how you feel, Matt, but first we
have to defeat Kiwimon!

430
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,910
How can you understand how I feel?

431
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,550
I understand that if we don't beat him
first, we won't be able to fight TK!

432
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,290
No!

433
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,110
First we find TK, then we'll fight your
war!

434
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,010
Right, Matt!

435
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,670
Kabumon!

436
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,411
Warp digivolve to... Huh?

437
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,390
It won't glow!

438
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,150
What's going on here, Matt?

439
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,910
How come I can't digivolve?

440
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,750
Pummel pet!

441
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,130
There!

442
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,590
Done!

443
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,030
I said I like to make friends and I've
made one!

444
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,070
Huh?

445
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,670
TK?

446
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:31,671
Why?

447
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,470
It's Lord Puppetmon's new toy!

448
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,310
Where's he going?

449
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,526
We're gonna place your rights!

450
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,786
Maybe he doesn't know how to play!

451
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,810
Yeah, that's it!

452
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,130
TK!

453
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:44,790
TK!

454
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,390
TK!

455
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,710
TK!

456
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,270
TK!

457
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,430
TK!

458
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,170
TK!

459
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,410
TK!

460
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
TK!

461
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,510
TK!

462
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,730
TK!

463
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:35,490
TK!

464
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,491
Thanks a lot!

465
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,510
You're welcome!

466
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,570
Be-o-mon!

467
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,910
Be-o-mon, what did you do?

468
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,810
Look what your Digimon did!

469
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,910
Without Kiwimon, we'll never find TK!

470
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,490
Calm down, Matt!

471
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,130
Hey!

472
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,330
It's TK!

473
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,490
Hey, everybody!

474
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:52,990
Hi!

475
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,690
I'm back!

476
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,090
TK!

477
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,610
See, everybody?

478
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,930
I told you I could do it!

479
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,710
I can take care of myself just fine!

480
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,570
You're the man!

481
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:05,571
Nice going, TK!

482
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,690
Great job, buddy!

483
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,510
We were worried about you!

484
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,870
Boy, for a little kid, that was a pretty
big escape!

485
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,670
Stop it, guys!

486
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,290
You're embarrassing me!

487
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,291
What's wrong, Matt?

488
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:14,630
Huh?

489
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,530
I also smashed the remote control that was
making the ground move underneath us!

490
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,030
That's terrific, TK!

491
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,410
Rodigious!

492
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,230
Everything's gonna be alright now!

493
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,810
Puppa Mom was using these dolls to control
us!

494
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,870
That's why all those weird things were
happening!

495
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,290
Is this me?

496
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,750
I don't look anything like this!

497
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,030
Huh!

498
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,450
Wow, Mimi, your doll is really pretty!

499
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,030
What?

500
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,650
No way!

501
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,290
I would never wear rags like this!

502
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,230
Oh!

503
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,470
I could take her to the mall for some new
clothes!

504
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,920
So he didn't want to play with me,
huh?

505
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,580
TK, you'll pay for this!

506
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,960
Can anybody see where Matt went?

507
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He's right over there!

508
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,240
Huh?

509
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:00,980
Huh?

510
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
I don't get it!

511
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,620
He and Gobble Mom were there a second ago!

512
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
They vanished!

513
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,100
Here we go again!

514
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,740
Will Puppet Mom take revenge on TK?

515
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,500
Is he behind Matt's disappearance?

516
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,880
Find out on the next Digimon Digital
Monsters!
