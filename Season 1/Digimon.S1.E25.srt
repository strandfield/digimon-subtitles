1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,240
DemiDevimon tricked Izzy and made him fall
into Vedamon's universe.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,741
Convincing Izzy to
give up his curiosity,

3
00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:09,220
Vedamon turned him
into a total-like zombie.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,820
To make things worse, that Brainhead got
hold of his tag and crest.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,840
Tentomon got so bummed out that he
de-digivolved to Pabumon.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,417
Thankfully, Izzy finally
snapped out of it, and

7
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:22,241
with Pabumon's help,
got back the tag and crest.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,020
Pabumon digivolved to Mega Kabuterimon and
sent Vedamon clear into another dimension.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:27,520
Ha!

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
Later, Brainhead!

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Digimon!

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,560
Digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Change into digital champions to save the
digital world!

14
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,540
Digimon!

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,240
Digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,980
Digimon!

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,420
Digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Digimon!

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
Digimon!

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,020
Digital monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,700
Digimon!

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,070
Digital monsters, Digimon!

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,790
Hey, what's wrong, you guys?

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,190
Can't you make this bucket go any faster?

25
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,670
What are you doing to help?

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,890
Watching for icebergs?

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,550
We'd gladly trade places with you,
but...

28
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,130
Unfortunately, our little legs won't reach
the pedals.

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,690
Hey, we could go faster if we threw you
off.

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,870
You wouldn't.

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,930
It's tempting.

32
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,130
Better not.

33
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,590
Wow, that palace is huge.

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,670
And way up there, as if my legs weren't
tired already.

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,730
But there's no doubt about it.

36
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,010
That is Mimi.

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,310
So up we go.

38
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,370
How do they get their mail?

39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,210
All right, you know the drill.

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,850
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,930
Get out of my way!

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,970
Is this a palace?

43
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,370
Or some kind of a loony bin?

44
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,450
Seems like it's both.

45
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,770
Unless she's getting angry!

46
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,390
Oh, these are Geckomon?

47
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,450
I've heard of them.

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,770
They really love music.

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,910
Not surprising since they're born with
those horns.

50
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,670
Hurry!

51
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,150
Before she blows her tongue!

52
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,010
And I've heard of the other Digimon.

53
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,830
They're called Otamomon!

54
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,690
Hurry!

55
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,930
Hurry!

56
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,090
Can you help us?

57
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,230
We're looking for someone.

58
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,690
What time you got here?

59
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:50,990
Where's the triple hot fight sundae we
ordered for delivery to the princess?

60
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,190
That's not us!

61
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,183
Then you must be
delivering her bacon chili

62
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,950
cheeseburger with fries
and a super-sized milkshake!

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,050
That's not us either!

64
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,510
Of course not!

65
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,610
They're delivering the garden fresh salad
with little fat dressing without dessert!

66
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,790
We'd like to ask a question if you don't
mind.

67
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,390
Her highness asked for a fight sundae!

68
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:08,690
No!

69
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,230
She wants a bacon chili cheeseburger!

70
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:10,670
Excuse me!

71
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,370
She said she wanted a green salad!

72
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,450
Hey, excuse me!

73
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,130
Have you seen a girl in a hat?

74
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,550
We're ordering lunch here!

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,830
Well, then I'll have a burger!

76
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,770
All the princess really cares about is
that polka dot party dress she ordered!

77
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,550
Old news!

78
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,070
Now she wants pink leather pants with
matching boots and accessories!

79
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,450
No one told me that!

80
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,930
Oh, get with the program!

81
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
That's not my problem!

82
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,570
You're making it my problem!

83
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,210
It sounds to me like this princess of
theirs is extremely picky.

84
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,590
She sounds kind of spoiled if you ask me.

85
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,650
I wonder what happens if they don't do
what she says!

86
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:42,890
No!

87
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,130
Here she comes!

88
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,390
Presenting!

89
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,490
Her highness!

90
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,590
The princess!

91
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,190
Cool!

92
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,890
We're gonna get to meet the princess!

93
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,650
Huh?

94
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,910
It's Mimi!

95
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,610
Oh, bummer!

96
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,210
Huh?

97
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,550
What a surprise!

98
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,690
You're telling me!

99
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,930
What are you doing up there?

100
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,070
What do you think?

101
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm being a princess, of course!

102
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,050
So you're the spoiled princess we've been
hearing about!

103
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,630
We should've known it was Mimi!

104
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,850
Don't call me Mimi anymore!

105
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,290
That's princess now!

106
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,870
Don't you worry, almighty wickedness!

107
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,510
This time we cannot fail!

108
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:23,930
We?

109
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,590
You'd better not fail!

110
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,570
It's in the bag!

111
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,370
Piece of cake!

112
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,350
Is the plan at the palace working?

113
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
Couldn't be better!

114
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,770
The Gekkomon are spoiling her rotten and
she's eating it up!

115
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:38,450
If she keeps this up much longer, her crest
of sincerity's gonna be useless, master!

116
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,950
Do you know what will happen if you
disappoint me again, Demidevamon?

117
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,710
I got a big idea!

118
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,270
Good.

119
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,950
Then see that you don't.

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,530
Well, the important thing is that you're
alright.

121
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,010
Yeah, that's for sure.

122
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,770
Well, come on.

123
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,630
Let's get a move on.

124
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,310
No way!

125
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:55,990
Right.

126
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,170
You want to change first.

127
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,570
We'll wait.

128
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,190
For what?

129
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,610
I'm keeping this dress on.

130
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,510
And it's beautiful, but it's not the best
thing to wear to walk long distances.

131
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,250
Walking?

132
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,230
I have no intention of walking anywhere.

133
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,490
Are you expecting us to carry you out of
here, your majesty?

134
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,470
No, I'm not going.

135
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:11,950
Huh?

136
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,550
Why would I leave?

137
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,110
I am a princess here.

138
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,070
Besides, who knows if we'll ever find our
way home.

139
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,250
So I might as well live large and in
charge.

140
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,510
You must be kidding.

141
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,130
No way!

142
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,930
Take a look around.

143
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,330
I've got a nice bed, pretty clothes,
food.

144
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,110
It's like having a birthday every day.

145
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,310
I am a princess.

146
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,370
And you want me to give this up?

147
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,510
I don't think so.

148
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,750
Is something wrong?

149
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,310
Another servant?

150
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,450
No, it's Palma.

151
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,786
And finally, a voice of reason.

152
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,630
Palma, come talk some sense into Mimi.

153
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,290
As in princess?

154
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,130
Oh no!

155
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,230
Not you too!

156
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,010
Uh-huh.

157
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,330
Okay, that's enough.

158
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,310
This is no time for playing games.

159
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,130
Both of you change out of those dumb
clothes and let's get out of here.

160
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,250
I am not playing a game, Ty.

161
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,470
I'm staying.

162
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,730
You can go any time.

163
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,750
Why don't you guys go look for the others?

164
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,270
Be gone from my palace!

165
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,150
Wait, Mimi.

166
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,950
Don't be mean.

167
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,810
They're our friends.

168
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,630
If you want to go, be my guest.

169
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,090
You are coming with us.

170
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,210
Get down off that high horse of yours and
shift your rear into high gear.

171
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,090
Yeah, come on.

172
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,970
Why do you think we almost killed
ourselves trying to find you?

173
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,610
Cause you were part of the team.

174
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,210
That's very nice, but I am not going.

175
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,211
That's it, Mimi.

176
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,770
Like it or not, Joe's right.

177
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,050
We've got to stick together.

178
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,750
So I'm not budging from this spot until
you come to your senses and leave with us.

179
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,250
Yeah!

180
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,490
Right!

181
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,190
Really?

182
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,990
You all keep forgetting who's in charge
around here.

183
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,470
Your Highness, what is it that you desire?

184
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,430
I desire these rude and bothersome peasants
to be removed from my boudoir at once.

185
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,431
Yes, Princess!

186
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,870
Hey!

187
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,150
Stop pushing!

188
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,610
I can't get your little frog hands off of
me!

189
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,910
Look out!

190
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,910
Oh, Mimi.

191
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,910
I won't dissect frogs in biology,
Kay!

192
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,270
If that's the way you treat your guests,
we're never coming back.

193
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,370
Now what are we going to do?

194
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,690
She's totally into this digi fairy tale.

195
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,310
I wonder what she could have done to get
them to wait on her hand and foot like this.

196
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,470
You really want to know?

197
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:04,770
Huh?

198
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,330
Uh, sure.

199
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,850
You're not taking us to an evil Digimon,
are you?

200
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,250
What if Mimi catches us?

201
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,370
She won't!

202
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,200
Here's our master, Lord Shogun-man!

203
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,740
Whoa!

204
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,040
Somebody's had a few too many donuts!

205
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,280
Is it a statue or what?

206
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,080
No, it's not a statue.

207
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
He's very much alive.

208
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
Huh?

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
He may be alive, but he's not lively,
is he?

210
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
He's sleeping!

211
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,150
He's been this way for over 300 years!

212
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:41,145
You see, Lord Shogun-man was proud of his
voice and ended his singing contest, but.

213
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:41,470
..

214
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:42,471
He lost!

215
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,470
He felt so bad, he fell into a deep sleep
from which he's never recovered!

216
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,410
It said only a voice as beautiful as the
one that beat him can wake him!

217
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,110
For centuries we've tried, but every
song's failed!

218
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,628
We Gekko-man love music,
but unfortunately not one

219
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,171
of us has a voice that would
be considered beautiful!

220
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,230
Then we got a break!

221
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,750
A strange little Digimon spoke of a girl
with a pretty voice.

222
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,350
He told us where to find her and we did!

223
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,970
I want to sing a song!

224
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,450
A song that'll wake you up!

225
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,310
And when you hear my voice, you'll call me
a sweet buttercup!

226
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,770
Whoa!

227
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,990
Just give me a listen!

228
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,030
Wow!

229
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,890
You mean all this is for me?

230
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,990
Maybe this will help you remember the
words.

231
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,890
I want to sing a song!

232
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,890
A song that will wake you up!

233
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,930
When you hear my voice, you'll call me!

234
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,850
Hmm... About we get a disco
ball and some spotlights, huh?

235
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,570
And of course, we'll need hair,
makeup, and costumes!

236
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
Oh, I'm tired!

237
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
Let's pick it up tomorrow!

238
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,280
And that's the way it's been!

239
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,700
One excuse after another!

240
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,540
We've done all she's wanted!

241
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,480
We've even redecorated the entire palace
for her!

242
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,700
I used to like Pink, but now I can't stand
to look at it!

243
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,280
And if any one of us
complains to her... Whoa!

244
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,260
Be careful!

245
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,340
You wouldn't want me to lose my voice now,
would you?

246
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,340
So we're in a terrible position,
you see?

247
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
We're totally helpless!

248
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,340
Unfortunately, you've given Mimi the life
she's been accustomed to, and then some!

249
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
Well, that you're friends of hers!

250
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,220
Could you please reason with her,
please?

251
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,740
We'd be so eternally grateful!

252
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,980
I don't think she knows what reason is!

253
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,880
Just leave it to me, guys!

254
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,700
I've got it!

255
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Huh?

256
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,380
I knew it!

257
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,580
I knew you'd come through!

258
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,160
Yay!

259
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,940
What are you thinking, Ty?

260
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,460
Well, who says you need Mimi to wake up
Jumbo?

261
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,240
Crank it up and let me take a shot!

262
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,920
You?

263
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,680
What you laughing at?

264
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm gonna sing a song!

265
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,360
A song that will wake you up!

266
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm gonna belt it out!

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,180
Sugar and Ma, it's time to get out!

268
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,770
Hey, wake up!

269
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:30,771
I'm

270
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,920
attaching to sing a song!

271
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:38,420
A song that will waken you and aid all the
Gecko mom!

272
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,160
That are loyal to your world view,
and the idea of you being in charge!

273
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,020
I'm attaching to sing a song!

274
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,660
A song that will wake you and aid all the
Gecko mom!

275
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,380
I Mario this song to you!

276
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,860
A tune from now until June!

277
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,540
When you hear us sing, you'll call us
singing baboons!

278
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,180
Boons!

279
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,240
We just want to wake ya!

280
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,700
So don't close your ears!

281
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,000
Or you can sleep for years!

282
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
It's no use.

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,200
After that, he might not wake up for
another 300 years.

284
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,860
Hey guys!

285
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,520
Palma, why did you all disappear like
that?

286
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,780
It's like you weren't even happy to see
us.

287
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,040
What are you talking about?

288
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,480
In case you hadn't noticed, Mimi's gone
nuts.

289
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:21,860
Yeah?

290
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Hmm.

291
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,460
Now that I think of it, she has kind of
gone off the deep end.

292
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,620
I mean, even for her.

293
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,860
Oh, you noticed?

294
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,100
You're so observant.

295
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,600
So, she'll be performing and won't even
know it.

296
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,540
Yeah, and we'll get the whole thing on
tape.

297
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Watch it!

298
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,980
What's this?

299
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,340
It's a karaoke set.

300
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,140
Yes, I can see that.

301
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,440
But what's it doing in my royal chambers?

302
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,560
I just love hearing you sing!

303
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,520
I thought you might give us a private
concert!

304
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Here!

305
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,160
Hmm... Thanks!

306
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
You're the greatest!

307
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
Now, feel the music!

308
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Feel the music!

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,200
Ty, is she falling for it?

310
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Huh?

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
What's that chord for?

312
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
I see...

313
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,760
So, you thought you could put a fast one
on Princess Mimi, did you?

314
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,200
That's Princess Mimi!

315
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah!

316
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,640
Who do you think you are, anyway?

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
Don't you remember we're your friends?

318
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,980
I remember you tried to trick me.

319
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,500
We tried to trick you because we're trying
to save you.

320
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,860
Have you completely forgotten about the
Crest of Sincerity?

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,080
Have you completely forgotten it's not
nice to lock people up in your dungeon?

322
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Where's your manners?

323
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Wait!

324
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,300
Uh... Before you go, I have
something I want to tell you.

325
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,480
Nobody likes you more than I do.

326
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,520
It hurts me deeply to have to say
this, but... You're a spoiled brat!

327
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Oh!

328
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,080
Is that a fact?

329
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,610
Hmph!

330
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,070
What can I do?

331
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,370
Oh!

332
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Sorry!

333
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,030
Big deal!

334
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,370
You didn't sing even when we did what you
wanted!

335
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,510
You're on your own!

336
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,250
Wait!

337
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,170
Don't leave me!

338
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,930
I'll sing for you!

339
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,030
I promise!

340
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Help me, please!

341
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,960
Sorry, but we only help our friends!

342
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,080
What's wrong, Mimi?

343
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,220
Well, what's the matter?

344
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,340
I thought you were ahead of the time of
your life.

345
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,280
Helmon!

346
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,680
I've gotta go now, Mimi!

347
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,220
Goodbye!

348
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:47,960
Oh!

349
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Oh!

350
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,620
Won't anybody help me?

351
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Please!

352
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Helmon!

353
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,120
Don't leave me!

354
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Hey!

355
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Hey!

356
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Hey, Mimi!

357
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,220
Where am I?

358
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:04,820
What?

359
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,100
Do you have any idea what that horrible
dream was trying to tell you, Mimi?

360
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm sorry!

361
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,180
Oh, I really am!

362
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,200
Well, then you know what you have to do to
make things right.

363
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Yes.

364
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
That a girl!

365
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,600
I knew you'd find yourself again!

366
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Zora?

367
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,990
What now?

368
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,130
The princess wants you!

369
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,970
Is she gonna chop off our heads?

370
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,110
Don't even joke.

371
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,050
What's going on?

372
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,590
What's she up to?

373
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,710
First of all, there's something I have to
say to everyone here.

374
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,350
Ty and Joe, Agamon and Gomamon,
Palmon, all of you have been so nice.

375
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,490
I'm so sorry.

376
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
What does he say?

377
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,730
I've been such a little idiot.

378
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,990
If you could find it in your hearts to
forgive me, and I don't know why you

379
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:15,890
would, but if you can, then I'd be honored
to sing for you one more time.

380
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,570
We forgive you.

381
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,430
Of course we do sing, your highness!

382
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,890
Yay!

383
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,410
Yes!

384
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,490
Thank you!

385
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,510
Hit the lights and cue the music!

386
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,590
I

387
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:45,710
wanna sing a song A song to bring
Shogunmon around When he hears my voice I

388
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:57,430
hope he likes the sound He has to listen
Listen to my sincere heart I've learned

389
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:03,205
that friends are friends
Even when they're apart My

390
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:09,840
friends do forgive me from
the bottom of my heart Yes!

391
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,480
If it's my choice, his eyes will open

392
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:30,010
We'll be cheering Cheering
with pride Don't panic!

393
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:36,570
It's our lord and master Shogunmon Finally
restored to us after so many centuries I

394
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:40,890
was having such a nice sleep Which one of
you clowns woke me up?

395
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,650
Or should I just squish all of you?

396
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,970
Women and Yakuman first!

397
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,027
And I thought I was
cranky when I first wake

398
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,470
up Give me the main
meaning back any day!

399
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,890
Whose idea was this?

400
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,770
Remind me never to listen to them again!

401
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,090
You wanna hear some singing?

402
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,990
The ground will shake When you hear the
noise I make Because I'm glad to be awake

403
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,470
Yeah!

404
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:13,870
Whoa And you are You

405
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:47,400
know where is your arms you?

406
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,560
That old Mimi's back.

407
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,260
Really?

408
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,960
You mean it?

409
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,700
Then let's take care of this out-of-tune
goon.

410
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,880
Hey, you!

411
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,240
How about some gratitude?

412
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,060
I saved you out of your 300-year nap,
you wannabe crooner!

413
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,140
Oh, that racket?

414
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,880
It was you?

415
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
Uh-oh.

416
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Oh, have you come to play?

417
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Loverplay!

418
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
Hartpool Torpedo!

419
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
Now it's zoo time!

420
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,380
Now why'd you try that?

421
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:18,280
Cause I'll knock you flat!

422
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
And now you're gonna feel it!

423
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,050
Did you see that?

424
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,830
Yeah, he gives new meaning to the term
flat note.

425
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,250
Watch out below!

426
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,251
Do it!

427
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,750
Do it!

428
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,370
What is it?

429
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,730
He deserved to hear that last flat note,
don't you think?

430
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,790
Well, ready to go, Mimi?

431
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,710
Yeah, do you think I can take some of my
princess clothes with me?

432
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,210
Mimi!

433
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,470
Well, it just seems such a waste,
the jewels at least.

434
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,110
Didn't you say you knew it would happen if
you failed?

435
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,036
Well, when I said I
knew, I didn't really

436
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:51,570
mean that I knew knew,
you know what I mean?

437
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,439
But now that I do know
if it's not to my trouble,

438
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,031
sir, can I bother you
for a glass of water?

439
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Yeah.

440
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,410
Yeah.
