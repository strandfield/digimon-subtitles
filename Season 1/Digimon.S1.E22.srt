1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,861
Coromon and I didn't know how, but we were
transported back to my real-life hometown.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,680
Not only was everything exactly the same
as it was when I left for camp,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,580
it was even the same day I arrived in
DigiWorld.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,400
Other things were weird, too.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,920
My little sister, Kari, somehow knew all
about Coromon.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,160
For some reason, evil Digimon were trying
to cross over into the real world.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,300
We received a transmission from Izzy
warning us not to return to DigiWorld,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,020
but we knew we had to go back.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,940
We had to save both worlds!

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,940
Digimon!

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
Digital Monsters!

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,400
Digimon are the champions!

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,060
Change into Digital Champions to save the
digital world!

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Digimon!

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Digital Monsters!

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,080
Digimon are the champions!

17
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,580
Digimon!

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,820
Digital Monsters!

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,260
Digimon are the champions!

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,400
Digimon!

21
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:20,450
Digital Monsters!

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,910
Digimon are the champions!

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,370
Digimon!

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,630
Digital Monsters!

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,070
Digimon are the champions!

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,830
Digimon!

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,770
Digital Monsters!

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:36,230
Digimon are the champions!

29
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,490
Digimon!

30
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,550
Digital Monsters!

31
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:38,550
Digimon!

32
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,410
This is right where we left them.

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,610
Where could they have gone?

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,010
Huh?

35
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,751
Well, looks like somebody's around, because
I'm getting a reading from their digivice.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,150
Hmm.

37
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,550
Okay, I've got a lock.

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,350
North-northwest, just a couple of clicks.

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,290
Very impressive, Ty.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,350
You really sound like you know what you're
doing.

41
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,950
I just watch a lot of TV.

42
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,830
Just what is a click?

43
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,090
I don't know exactly, but we're getting
closer.

44
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,210
I hope so.

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,410
I'm hungry.

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,930
Look at this place.

47
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,910
Where are we?

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,230
I don't know, but it's the most beautiful
place I've ever seen.

49
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,530
Come on.

50
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,490
The signal's getting stronger.

51
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,710
Who is it?

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,590
Who is it?

53
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,710
It's Tokomon.

54
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,390
Tokomon!

55
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,930
Hey, what happened, little guy?

56
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,130
Are you all right?

57
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,030
Not exactly.

58
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,790
You look like Ty.

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,800
You're alive.

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,176
Yeah, the last time I checked.

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,300
I'll bet a black-eared Digimon got you
right.

62
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,240
No, if it was something simple like that,
I wouldn't feel so bad.

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Where is everybody?

64
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Where's TK?

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,600
I don't know.

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,200
He's probably out for this new friend.

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,160
New friend?

68
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,980
What new friend?

69
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,820
I think you better ask TK.

70
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
I would, but he's not here, and you are.

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,860
Now start at the beginning, Tokomon,
and tell me exactly what happened.

72
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Well, you were gone an awful long time.

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
We were?

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,660
How long?

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
We looked high and low for you.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,160
I did most of the low part.

77
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
Finally!

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
It's no use.

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,100
We're practically lost ourselves.

80
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,820
Oh, personally, I've been lost ever since
I got here.

81
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,800
What about Jedi?

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,420
Maybe he can help us find them.

83
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,020
Yeah, and where do we find Jedi?

84
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,200
I think one wild goose chase is enough.

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,860
This is the most depressing camp out ever.

86
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,850
Won't TK be upset?

87
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,870
Maybe, but he'll be safer here.

88
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,210
Shh!

89
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,210
We're going off to find Tai on our own.

90
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,130
Don't wake anyone.

91
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,610
We'll see you later, Tokomon.

92
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,870
Oh, okay.

93
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,170
That's how it started.

94
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,390
First Sora left.

95
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,110
Then we all went in search of Sora.

96
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,990
Then someone said maybe we'd cover more
ground if we split up.

97
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,070
So Izzy and Tintamon went up one way.

98
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,410
And Joe and Gomamon went up another.

99
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,830
And pretty soon, only Matt, TK,
Gabumon, and me were left.

100
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,390
Why did everybody go away?

101
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,150
When you're lost, you're supposed to stay
together.

102
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,430
We just had different ideas of what was
the best thing to do, TK.

103
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,850
We've looked everywhere, TK.

104
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,410
If they were anywhere in this area,
we would have found them.

105
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,750
We could have missed something.

106
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,030
We've got to keep searching.

107
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,090
Come on, Matt.

108
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,086
If we hurry, we could still catch up
with some... Hey, it's hopeless, all right?

109
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,670
We've already done everything we could.

110
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,750
Oh, come on.

111
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,230
Don't cry.

112
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,330
I didn't mean it.

113
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,250
Don't worry.

114
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,370
Wherever Agumon and Tai are, I'm sure
they're perfectly all right.

115
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,570
Really, Matt?

116
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,590
Any minute now, they'll be coming back,
right?

117
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,690
And they'll bring a bunch of presents with
them.

118
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,430
Oh, wow.

119
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,230
You think so?

120
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,750
I hope you're right.

121
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,390
I sure miss my friends.

122
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,710
I knew Matt was just kidding TK about the
presents.

123
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,710
But that didn't matter, because
just then... Oh, look, Matt!

124
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,990
Is it real?

125
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,210
Everybody's gonna love this place.

126
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,650
But Matt didn't seem too excited.

127
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,490
It was like there was something on his
mind that he couldn't stop thinking about.

128
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,370
Look at this!

129
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,470
No lines!

130
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,510
Actually, there are no people here at all.

131
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,470
Maybe they forgot to tell us that they're
closed.

132
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,450
So, TK, you sure you'll be all right?

133
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,710
I'll be fine.

134
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,770
Don't worry about me.

135
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,930
That's my big little bro.

136
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,010
But you'll be back pretty soon,
right?

137
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,490
Right.

138
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,086
I'm just gonna look around a little.

139
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,370
Really check this place out.

140
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,770
I'll be back in maybe a couple of hours at
the most.

141
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,530
Tokomon, you're responsible for looking
after him, okay?

142
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,330
Sure!

143
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,590
Don't worry.

144
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,270
We'll be waiting right here.

145
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,770
Great!

146
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,750
And remember, it's an amusement park,
so, like, amuse yourself.

147
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,590
See you soon!

148
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,770
Okay, bye!

149
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,240
Hours went by and still no Matt.

150
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,040
He'll come back, TK.

151
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,020
I wonder what's keeping them.

152
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,580
You've gotta eat something.

153
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,340
Should've come back by now.

154
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,020
We waited at the park for almost a week.

155
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,186
TK spent the whole time
staring out at the water,

156
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:15,261
except when he just
couldn't stay awake anymore.

157
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,580
He waited... and waited.

158
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
He's coming.

159
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,180
Any minute now, I'll see his boat out
there.

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,380
Don't cry again!

161
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,400
He's gone!

162
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
I just know it!

163
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,760
He's gone away like all the others!

164
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,520
He said he'd be back in a couple of hours!

165
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,440
Now don't give him hope!

166
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,820
Hey!

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
What's all the squawking about?

168
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,300
Demi Devamon's a name.

169
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Mind if I drop in?

170
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,840
Demi Devamon?

171
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,100
I've heard about you.

172
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh, great!

173
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,340
I'm flattered!

174
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,160
Don't be.

175
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,580
Nothing I heard was good.

176
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,420
Okay, okay.

177
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,357
I admit I used to be
a bit of a wise guy, but

178
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,540
that's only because I
was working for Edamon.

179
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,620
But now he's kaput thanks to you guys,
something for which I'm eternally grateful.

180
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,800
Personally, I never liked the guy.

181
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,000
You see, my brother out there is in a
boat.

182
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Oh, is that what's got you down squirt
before you come to the right, Digimon?

183
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,940
What's his name, your brother?

184
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
His name is Matt.

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,640
Got it.

186
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,760
Let me see what I can do.

187
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Back in the flash.

188
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Well, maybe he has changed.

189
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
You think?

190
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,960
I couldn't believe that one of Edamon's
creepy henchmen was being helpful,

191
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,300
but sure enough, just a few minutes
later... Sorry to keep you waiting.

192
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,360
What about it?

193
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Did you find my brother?

194
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Did you find him?

195
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Sure I did.

196
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
Is he on his way back?

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Well, that's the bad news, kid.

198
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

199
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,214
It kills me to have
to be the one to break

200
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,240
this to you, but your
bro ain't coming back.

201
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,180
In fact, he never wants to see you again.

202
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,060
Said he was tired of babysitting a
crybaby.

203
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
No way!

204
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,400
It can't be true, TK.

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,040
He called me... Crybaby,
yeah, that's what he said.

206
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,080
He called you some other stuff,
too, but I don't want to repeat it.

207
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Anyway, he's gone...

208
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
No!

209
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,560
Don't take it so hard!

210
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I'm lying to you, too!

211
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm lying to you, too!

212
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,560
Come on, Matt would never say stuff like
that.

213
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,020
Besides, we've been working on the crying
thing, and you're getting better.

214
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
You really are.

215
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,060
Don't believe that guy.

216
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,860
Hey, Flopsy!

217
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,980
You have to stop lying to TK.

218
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,660
Lies?

219
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,060
Whatever could you mean by that?

220
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,980
You take back all those lies, or you'll be
sorry.

221
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,700
My, my, those are pretty bold words coming
from a pink jubber with an overbite.

222
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,820
Besides, do you have any proof that I'm
lying about it, huh?

223
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,120
Well, no.

224
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,121
There you go.

225
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,680
You're just assuming the worst because of
my background.

226
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
That's not fair.

227
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,720
It's prejudice.

228
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,600
That's what it is.

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,444
Just because I'm
not a cuddly butterball

230
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,620
like you, then you think
I must be a bad guy.

231
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,820
That's so, I don't know, superficial.

232
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,160
Luckily, TK's more enlightened.

233
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,096
Tokamon, what are you doing?

234
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,740
What, TK?

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,700
I saw you take a shot at him.

236
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,540
Don't be too hard on him, TK.

237
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,800
I understand what the poor guy's feeling.

238
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,981
It's only naturally to be a little resentful
that you found yourself a new friend.

239
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
Hmph!

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,680
I don't know what's gotten into you,
but I think an apology's in order.

241
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,980
Well, don't hold your breath.

242
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,620
Do it!

243
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,000
I will not.

244
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,980
If you like that flying rat so much,
maybe I ought to leave.

245
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,220
If you won't apologize, you have to leave.

246
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
You really mean it?

247
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Yeah, sure.

248
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
Go on.

249
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,780
I won't be coming back, you know.

250
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,121
You don't see me crying about it, and I
don't want these stupid gadgets either.

251
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Come on, Demi-Devamon.

252
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,620
Let's go ride the roller coaster.

253
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,920
That suits me fine.

254
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Goodbye.

255
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
You see, Ty, we go away for a couple of
days and everything falls apart.

256
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:50,980
Hmm.

257
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,940
First let's find out what TK's up to,
then we'll look for Matt and the others.

258
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,420
Take us to him, Tokomon.

259
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
You got it.

260
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
That's the place?

261
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,180
Yeah, TK's somewhere in there with that
flying phony.

262
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,620
We'll make those kids pay for what they
did to Lord Edamon.

263
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,140
Wait.

264
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,460
Those punk kids are not the pushoers they
look like.

265
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,100
Right.

266
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
What do we get out of it except a
headache?

267
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,360
Let's face it.

268
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Edamon's washed up.

269
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,160
Why knock ourselves out for that creep?

270
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,960
Good question.

271
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,580
I never liked working for him anyway.

272
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,980
I say we take a lunch break.

273
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,860
So where can we get some grub around here?

274
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,500
Well, uh... If you like
mushrooms, I know just the place.

275
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,120
Woo-wee, ain't this a gas?

276
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,020
We're having some fun now, huh?

277
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,820
Ha-ha!

278
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Ha-ha!

279
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,680
Ha-ha!

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,440
Ha-ha!

281
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,160
Ha-ha!

282
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,660
Hey TK, I bet I can spin farther than you!

283
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,860
Hmm... Tokomon's awful
small to be all on his own.

284
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020
I hope he's okay.

285
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,220
Forget about him, will ya?

286
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,700
Come on, let's try the highway!

287
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,760
All right.

288
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:58,440
Okay, TK, really wrap this baby up!

289
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,400
Put the pedal to the metal and feel the
freedom of the open road!

290
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Woo-hoo!

291
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,860
This is so much fun, it ought to be
illegal!

292
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,420
Okay, you gotta scream at the top of your
lungs!

293
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:07,800
Ready?

294
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Whoa!

295
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,280
This kid's getting to be a real drag.

296
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,460
You're not still thinking about Tokomon,
are ya?

297
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,720
He made the decision to walk out on you!

298
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,540
Not much of a friend if you ask me!

299
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,840
I know, but I can't help wondering if he's
okay.

300
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,220
This is gonna be harder than I thought!

301
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,380
Hey, I just remember, there's something
I've gotta take care of!

302
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
I'll be right back!

303
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
You're leaving me too?

304
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,160
Just for a minute, trust me!

305
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
You just stay and have fun!

306
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Huh?

307
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Why's it going off?

308
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,580
Could be trouble, that's what it usually
means!

309
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,520
Never mind that now, look who I found!

310
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
TK!

311
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Yoo-hoo!

312
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,380
TK!

313
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:54,560
Hey!

314
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,300
Hey!

315
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,780
It's my friend!

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hey, little guy!

317
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
You're back!

318
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,140
Yeah, and are we glad to see you!

319
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

320
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,020
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

321
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm so happy!

322
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,840
Aw, Ty!

323
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
I was worried!

324
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,280
You were gone so long!

325
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,100
We thought something bad must've happened!

326
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,740
Well, I'm back again, and I'm all in one
piece!

327
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
Eww!

328
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,300
Tokomon, you came back too!

329
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,780
Uh-huh!

330
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:19,140
So you finally admit that you were wrong
and you're gonna apologize to him now?

331
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,140
I wasn't wrong and I won't apologize!

332
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,220
Tokomon, what's happened to you?

333
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,700
When'd you get to be such a brat?

334
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,380
Okay, you two, chill out!

335
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,529
Knock off this bickering
right now because we've

336
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,500
got too many other
problems to worry about!

337
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,600
We've gotta go try and find Matt and all
the others!

338
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,480
Not me!

339
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Hmm?

340
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
Why should I?

341
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,980
They're not nice!

342
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,380
They left me behind!

343
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,080
First Sora, then Rest, then even my own
brother Matt!

344
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Come on, TK!

345
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,860
It's not your fault they left!

346
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,100
They hate me!

347
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,060
They think I'm a crybaby!

348
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,920
Even Matt said I was!

349
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,600
Whoa, man!

350
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,220
I don't know what this new friend of yours
has been telling you!

351
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,460
But I happen to know for a fact that Matt
does not hate you!

352
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,780
Well, you might not be saying
such nice things about him if you

353
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,680
knew that I wanted to keep
searching for you, but he didn't!

354
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,580
It's true!

355
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
He's really jealous of you, Ty!

356
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:10,151
Haven't you ever noticed he
gets all upset when you and me

357
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:12,880
do stuff together and he
hates it when I talk about you?

358
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,160
Huh?

359
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,600
Do you think I could be your little
brother instead?

360
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,000
What?

361
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,420
Please!

362
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,500
Uh, I don't think it works that way.

363
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,480
Why not?

364
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,260
It just doesn't, that's all!

365
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,200
Uh, you don't like me either!

366
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,700
Hey!

367
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,180
What would Edamon say if he saw you two
lounging around like that?

368
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,700
Who?

369
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Edamon what?

370
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Who's that?

371
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,760
No idea!

372
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,740
Uh, who are you, come to think of it?

373
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Who am I?

374
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,300
Guess I forgot!

375
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:36,480
Matt!

376
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
What do you know?

377
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,120
The famous mushrooms of forgetfulness!

378
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,322
I've always wondered if
these things really work and

379
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,760
judging from the two of you
clowns, they obviously do!

380
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,160
Feed the kid a few of these and he'll
forget all about that Tokomon!

381
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,180
So I'll be your big brother, but just
temporarily until we find Matt, okay?

382
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:52,780
Okay!

383
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,080
Look, it's Demi Devilmon!

384
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,940
That's him?

385
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,940
Not the most trustworthy looking guy I've
ever seen!

386
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,160
Welcome back Tokomon, how you been?

387
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,380
Okay, what did Matt really say to you?

388
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,260
Cool it buddy, just who are you anyway?

389
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,480
We're friends of TK's real friends!

390
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,940
Start talking and it better be the truth
this time!

391
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,980
It happened just like I told TK!

392
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,400
Matt said he was tired of the little guy
and didn't want to hang with him anymore!

393
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,888
I told Matt that
brothers really ought to

394
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,941
stick together, but he
wouldn't listen to me!

395
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,240
It's the truth, cross my heart!

396
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:25,300
If you've got one!

397
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,780
Hey!

398
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
Why would I lie?

399
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,000
Then you won't mind taking us to Matt so
we can ask him ourselves!

400
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,460
Not at all, but I gotta warn ya,
he's far away!

401
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,980
Let's get started then!

402
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
Fine, let's go!

403
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,220
But it's been a long day, wouldn't you
like something to eat first?

404
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I am hungry!

405
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,020
Me too!

406
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,300
Well in that case... I picked these
myself, they're fresh and juicy!

407
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,940
Hey wait, don't just eat them raw,
let's do this right!

408
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,960
Voila!

409
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,720
Les mushrooms de la barbecue!

410
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:54,040
They'll be ready in just a minute!

411
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,020
Oops-a-daisy!

412
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,980
Gotta use the little Digimon's room!

413
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,280
Don't forget to wash your hands or claws
or whatever they are!

414
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
What do you know?

415
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
More mushrooms!

416
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,020
Okay TK, you're first!

417
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,220
Tell me if it's too hot!

418
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,980
Womp womp!

419
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,380
I wouldn't touch it!

420
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
Hang on, this one didn't get cooked on one
side!

421
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,160
No offense to Ty, but I prefer mine raw!

422
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,161
Don't eat it!

423
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,020
They're the mushrooms of forgetfulness!

424
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,900
They'll make all your memories disappear!

425
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Who's there?

426
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,700
I know that voice, it's Sora!

427
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,680
If what she said about these
mushrooms is true, then that means... YAH!

428
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,480
Don't eat the mushrooms!

429
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,450
Yay!

430
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,770
Finally!

431
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,750
It's probably still a little hot,
huh?

432
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,850
Just blow on it!

433
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,010
There, now give it a try!

434
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,170
Smells yummy!

435
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,290
No, drop it!

436
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,930
Put it down!

437
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,450
Stop it!

438
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,550
Don't eat that mushroom!

439
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,530
It's all right, Agumon, there are plenty
of mushrooms to go around!

440
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:57,930
No!

441
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,210
Don't eat any of them!

442
00:15:59,290 --> 00:15:59,890
They're poison!

443
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,530
Evil!

444
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,290
Bad stuff!

445
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,670
Hey!

446
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,230
Wait!

447
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,870
You don't see him eating them!

448
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,510
Try one!

449
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,030
Come on!

450
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,130
Open up!

451
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,610
He won't eat one!

452
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,190
He was trying to slip us some kind of
mushroom that makes you forget things!

453
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:13,930
You're bad!

454
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,270
Huh?

455
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,650
Is that true?

456
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,130
Were you trying to poison us?

457
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,930
Don't be silly!

458
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,150
You're lying just like you lied about
Matt!

459
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,430
It was a lie, wasn't it?

460
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,610
YAH!

461
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:25,930
You flying brat!

462
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,050
Tokumon, can you ever forgive me?

463
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,510
If you promise, we'll always be friends!

464
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,690
Of course!

465
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,970
Good work!

466
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,770
At least that's one problem taken care of!

467
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,250
Here, TK, I thought you might want this
back.

468
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,470
You betcha!

469
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,610
Check it out!

470
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,930
TK's crest is glowing!

471
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,170
It's not good!

472
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,810
Who gave you the idea that crest was
yours?

473
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,230
Hand it over, you little squirt!

474
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,830
I'm gonna teach this Mona lesson!

475
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:52,850
Get it!

476
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,530
Go after him!

477
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,570
Digimon!

478
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,130
Digimon!

479
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,730
Digimon!

480
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,650
Digimon!

481
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,470
Digimon are the champions!

482
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,930
Oh!

483
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,440
Way to go, Padamon!

484
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Take him down!

485
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Come here!

486
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Padamon!

487
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,310
You know, you really should consider
running yourself out as a football!

488
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,810
Hang in there, Padamon!

489
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,890
We're on our way!

490
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
No!

491
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,190
Stay there!

492
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,290
Wait for us!

493
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,410
What are you doing?

494
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,010
Let him do what he's got to do.

495
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,250
I have a feeling he's going to be all
right.

496
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,390
What's this?

497
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,790
You're mine!

498
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,180
You were awesome, Padamon.

499
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,980
Now I feel even worse about the way I
treated you.

500
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,587
We promised we'd
always be friends and the

501
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,680
first rule of friendship
is forgive and forget.

502
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
Let's forget it ever happened,
okay?

503
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:41,120
Okay.

504
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,580
I'll pretend I had a bite of that funny
mushroom.

505
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Me too!

506
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,100
Aw, that's kind of cool, isn't it?

507
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Yeah!

508
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,300
And it wouldn't have happened if it hadn't
been for you, Agumon.

509
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,200
By the way, how did you find out about
those mushrooms anyway?

510
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,000
Uh, voice in my head!

511
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,460
You're kidding!

512
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,940
No!

513
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
I was close!

514
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
So close!

515
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,240
Uh-oh!

516
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,860
Now I'm in for it!

517
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,240
Forgive me, oh terrible one!

518
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,140
The Crest of Hope has regained its light!

519
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,900
I failed!

520
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,160
But I'll make it up to you!

521
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll work overtime!

522
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,180
And on Sundays!

523
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay, listen up.

524
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,520
Izzy was totally right when he said that
all the weird stuff going on here in the

525
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,100
Digiworld somehow affects our own world,
too!

526
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,140
I don't know how we're going to do it yet,
but it seems to me we've got to fix things

527
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,580
in this world before we can return to our
own world.

528
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:36,780
But if we're going to do that,
we've all got to work together as a team!

529
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,280
Every one of us is important!

530
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,560
Am I important, too?

531
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,300
Of course you are, TK!

532
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,540
You're a part of the team!

533
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,000
Now let's go find the others!

534
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Yay!

535
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,887
I guess we learned it doesn't
take a mushroom of forgetfulness

536
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,660
to make us sometimes
forget who our real friends are.

537
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,080
Yeah, sorry, Catamon.

538
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,540
It's forgotten, remember?

539
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
That's right, I forgot!

540
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:55,961
Haha!
