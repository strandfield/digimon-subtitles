1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,640
Continuing on our quest, we had yet
another run in with Kawagapai.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,320
Fortunately, the day was saved by a most
diminutive Digimon named Piximon,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
a wise trainer.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,154
His training methods at
first appeared a bit odd, but

5
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:13,520
later we found out it was
a form of self-discipline.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,943
Matt and I went off to
find our own crests, and

7
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,340
we found them in a
most unexpected location.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,464
Our nemesis, Edumon, must
have the entire area under

9
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:24,200
surveillance, because he
sent Taranumon to deal with us.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,800
Hagumon took care of that dino with no
problem.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,360
How prodigious!

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,430
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,990
Digimon!

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,590
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:59,090
Change into Digital Champions to save the
digital world!

16
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:00,450
Digimon!

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,090
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,380
Digimon!

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,180
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,220
What is it, Izzy?

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,640
Some kind of power generator?

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,311
Even better, Edimons
has hardwired the entire

23
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,901
desert, creating an
extensive computer network.

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,840
My guess, this is one of his remote data
access terminals.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
Great, let's crash it.

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,640
It could be a booby trap.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,680
If it is, Edimons, I say we cross the
wires and mess it up good.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,560
What are you going to do with that?

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
I wonder.

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,460
It's entirely possible that our computer
have compatible systems.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
And if they do, I can tap into Edimons'
network.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480
Hey, you have mail.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Oh, that was quick.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,180
Who even knows I've logged on?

35
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,600
Oh, no, it's Edimons.

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,640
Open it, it's probably just spam.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Right.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,940
Help me.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
S-O-S.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,120
Mayday.

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm being held prisoner.

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,440
Help me escape and I'll guide you to the
quest you seek.

43
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,820
Whoa.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
Do you think he's for real?

45
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,280
I mean, who could it be?

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,680
What do you mean the system's down?

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
I don't want to hear any excuses.

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,940
I want those stinking kids located now.

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,620
Yes, a mighty Edimons, sir.

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
Most majestic royal one.

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,660
The problem is, we've got a glitch at the
pyramid host computer.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,500
Datamon.

53
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:43,880
Get me there in a hurry, you plop of your
little freaks.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Let's roll.

55
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,760
Oh, I don't like this.

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,200
I don't like it one little bit.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,180
I don't like the look of it.

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,376
I don't like the smell of it.

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,420
I don't like the... You don't
have a brain cramp, Joe.

60
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,340
You're turning green around the edges.

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,540
Yeah, somebody asked for our help.

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,340
We've got to at least check it out,
right?

63
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,340
According to my laptop, we should be
getting close.

64
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,740
Hey, look!

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
It's glowing.

66
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
Oh!

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,000
Huh?

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,900
TK, come over here.

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,300
Look what I found.

70
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Look!

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,900
Another crest!

72
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Watch it!

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,880
Awesome!

74
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,881
My own crest!

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Congratulations!

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Now, TK, don't think this means you get to
stay up any later.

77
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,200
Sora's crest is the only one left to find.

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,880
Maybe if we rescue this guy, he can lead
us to it.

79
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,420
Well, what are we waiting for?

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,240
To the rescue!

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,420
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,220
What's that?

83
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Huh?

84
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,520
See these hieroglyphs?

85
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,660
Look familiar.

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,360
This is definitely the same writing we've
come across before.

87
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Wait a second.

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,700
This is a new one.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Oh!

90
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,780
Prodigious!

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
This is amazing!

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,660
Do you know what I'm thinking?

93
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,500
I've got a feeling you're going to tell
us.

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,925
Well, you see, it's quite
possible that these hieroglyphs

95
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:14,900
are not a form of writing
at all, but rather code.

96
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,980
Computer code.

97
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:19,500
If you change a piece of the code,
then you change the program.

98
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
Ah!

99
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,700
Like that, for example.

100
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,700
Wait.

101
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,720
Back up.

102
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,882
Are you telling us that this
whole place is some kind of

103
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:30,300
giant computer game and
that none of it is really real?

104
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,820
Oh, it's real, all right.

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,680
Huh?

106
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,400
You know, I'm thinking that everything we
see and everybody we meet in this place

107
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:41,700
are actually pieces of data or programming
given physical form.

108
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:42,701
Now, wait a second.

109
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,420
If you're writing this whole thing's one
big computer, then how did we get here?

110
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,220
Did we squeeze in through the floppy
drive?

111
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,620
No, we're just kilobytes of data,
too.

112
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,560
I mean, the versions of us that are in
here.

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,960
If I'm just data, why do I still feel like
I'm flesh and blood?

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,340
And I still have to go to the little
girl's room.

115
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
You don't really.

116
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,740
You just think you have to.

117
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,500
Oh, well, I hope you're right,
because... Where's the real us?

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,940
Our flesh and blood bodies?

119
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:06,941
I don't know.

120
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,000
I suppose we're back at the campground
still.

121
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh!

122
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,700
Yeah, we're alive back there.

123
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,460
We exist simultaneously with our other
selves.

124
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,220
We're in a parallel digital universe like
the Digimon.

125
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,420
Does that mean I don't have to worry about
brushing my teeth anymore?

126
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,980
We've got bigger things to worry about
now, TK.

127
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,220
Although, do us all a favor and don't stop
brushing.

128
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Yeah, please.

129
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,040
Hey!

130
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,060
Wait a second.

131
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,120
I've got an idea.

132
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,460
Let me see.

133
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,160
If I can just correct this program...

134
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Uh-oh!

135
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,340
He's in computer dark mode.

136
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
This could take a while.

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Whoa!

138
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,120
I've called up a holographic map of the
Digi-World.

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,160
You can see how physically similar it is
to the planet Earth.

140
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,060
In fact, there are a lot of parallels with
our world.

141
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,800
That's terrific, Izzy.

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,920
Great time for a geography lesson.

143
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,020
Pay attention and you might learn
something.

144
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,021
Yeah?

145
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,379
If I enter the email address
of the person who contacted

146
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,180
us, I can find his location
in the Digi-World here.

147
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,260
Now, look.

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,440
That email address is from a web domain in
our world.

149
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,440
I've logged on to it a thousand times.

150
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,200
Is there a point to this somewhere?

151
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,640
Is the person who sent the message in our
world or the Digi-World?

152
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,840
That's just the thingies in both.

153
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,000
Look.

154
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,600
The Digi-World's on the left.

155
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,380
The world we know is on the right.

156
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,860
And if I overlay them like so...

157
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,220
The white lines match up perfectly.

158
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
What does it mean?

159
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,660
Reminds me of the balls of Bjorn my kitty
used to play with.

160
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
That's the world's digital network.

161
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,460
Through those lines, every computer on
Earth is connected to every other computer.

162
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,720
The Digi-World is a physical embodiment of
the data passing through them.

163
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:52,820
Guys, we're seeing something nobody else
has ever seen that nobody even knows about.

164
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,120
The digital shadow world that exists
alongside our own.

165
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,900
And they're not just parallel,
they're physically linked.

166
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,740
So anything we do here will have effects
on the other.

167
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
For real?

168
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,760
Intense.

169
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,560
Yeah.

170
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
And here's the coolest part.

171
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,860
Wherever this person is in the Digi-World,
I think I can take us there just by

172
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:12,800
entering his email address and clicking on
it.

173
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,160
Like accessing a webpage.

174
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,260
Hey, all this techno-talk's making my head
spinning.

175
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,280
Computer guys can never just do something,
TK.

176
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
That'd be too easy.

177
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,520
They gotta spend all day telling you how
they'll do it.

178
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,440
This is depressing.

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,680
Even when on computer data I have
allergies.

180
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,720
Look on the bright side, Joe.

181
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,500
If you weren't here, you never would've
met me.

182
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,780
Sara, does this mean that we don't exist?

183
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,320
That we're really not friends?

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,840
Of course not.

185
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,961
This may be a make-believe world, but that
doesn't mean our friendship isn't real.

186
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,020
Truthfully, I don't get it, but it sounds
right.

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,800
Oh, well.

188
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,460
Wherever we are, we're here.

189
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,440
So let's figure out what we're gonna do
next.

190
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,020
Come on, Brainiac.

191
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,140
What are you waiting for?

192
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Okay, okay.

193
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,440
All I have to do is click on the guy's
email address and then bingo.

194
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,200
I hate bingo.

195
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,300
It's so confusing with all those different
letters and numbers.

196
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,300
Hey, look, a door.

197
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,160
All right, last one through is a rotten
egg.

198
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,620
Our electronic pen pal is right out there.

199
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,120
Or it could be a trap.

200
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,040
No way.

201
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,140
We're just bits of data, so I uploaded us
as file attacks.

202
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,141
Hey, I believe you.

203
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,000
Whoa, check this out.

204
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,040
Heads up, Edamon at 9 o'clock.

205
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,480
That's it.

206
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,240
It's a dumpster for you, Edamon,
you old pile of junk.

207
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,560
Uh, I think I left the water running back
at the Sphinx.

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,260
Okay, Ty, you're relieved.

209
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,300
It's our turn to stand watch.

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,080
Finally.

211
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,880
It's not much fun watching a bunch of
rocks.

212
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,470
Uh, goodnight.

213
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,140
I thought being in a computer cartoon
adventure would be more fun than this.

214
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
About tomorrow.

215
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,880
What?

216
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
I'm worried.

217
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
That Edamon is bad news.

218
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Is it really worth it just to find my
crest?

219
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,860
Sure.

220
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,180
Don't worry, Sora.

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,860
Piece of cake.

222
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,660
I'm looking forward to spinning that ugly
monkey around by his tail.

223
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Hey, come on.

224
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Snap out of it.

225
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Huh?

226
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,540
Look, if it was my crest or TK's or anyone
else's we were going after...

227
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,600
You know you wouldn't hesitate for a
second.

228
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Oh.

229
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Maybe you're right.

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,761
It's just, after what
Izzy said... What?

231
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,573
You mean all that stuff
about us being nothing but

232
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:32,320
little kilobytes in the great
computer program of life?

233
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,840
It just makes us seem so small and
insignificant.

234
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,840
Like nothing we do really matters.

235
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,580
Of course it matters.

236
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,600
We can't take the chance that it doesn't.

237
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,420
Remember, there's one thing that's
important to keep in mind.

238
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,140
This is more than a parallel universe.

239
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,880
It's a shadow world physically linked to
our own.

240
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,152
Anything that happens
here in the Digi-World can

241
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:55,920
have a direct effect on
the things in the other.

242
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,300
Then, the same thing goes for us,
right?

243
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,120
We're shadow versions of our other selves.

244
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,680
Right.

245
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,160
Exact computer copies.

246
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,895
So whatever happens,
we have to be just as

247
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,560
careful as if we were
still our physical selves.

248
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,500
Hey, sometime this year.

249
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,260
Man, you guys talk more than my mom's book
club.

250
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Can we go?

251
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Alright.

252
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,640
I got into the program and found the most
direct route to the center of the pyramid.

253
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,900
Okay now, let's get this straight.

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
We're only going in there to find this guy
and get Sora her crest, right?

255
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Right, right.

256
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,980
That means no fights or adventures or
dangerous stuff.

257
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,480
You whimper more than my puppy.

258
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,960
Matt, Mimi, TK, stay here and stand guard.

259
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Let's go in.

260
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,740
If you really don't think you need me,
I miss you guys already.

261
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,360
We'll be back in time to eat.

262
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Or get eaten.

263
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
See you guys!

264
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,460
Come back as soon as you can!

265
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,380
Okay, keep together.

266
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,410
There's a hidden back door to the program
we could use to get in.

267
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,270
It should be somewhere right up ahead.

268
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,130
That's funny.

269
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:24,990
It should be right here.

270
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,690
Where's my fried banana sandwich?

271
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,470
You know I like to eat after my nap.

272
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,070
Ty, what is it?

273
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,210
It's Edamon.

274
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,590
Who's there?

275
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,850
What do we do now?

276
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,110
Quiet, Biomon.

277
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,610
Great, now I'm hearing things.

278
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,530
Yoo-hoo!

279
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,990
Huh?

280
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,550
You know, I'm gonna have to have this
place completely exterminated.

281
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,570
Because...

282
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,390
Something's starting to bug me.

283
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,530
We've got him talking to himself.

284
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,710
Really funny, Ty.

285
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,530
Are you crazy?

286
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,990
What if you'd gotten us caught?

287
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,450
But we weren't, were we?

288
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,250
Well, now that we're in, what do we do?

289
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,370
I guess next we try to find a way through
these walls.

290
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,590
The trick is... finding the weak points.

291
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:15,730
Hey, I found one!

292
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:16,970
Oh!

293
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,390
Oh!

294
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,910
As I was saying, Agumon, the trick is
finding the weak points.

295
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,350
Let's use heads, not hands.

296
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Hey, check it out.

297
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,460
You can see right through this wall.

298
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,580
Yeah, here it is.

299
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,680
It's another breach in the system's
security.

300
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,440
Look!

301
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Gaffimon!

302
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Be still.

303
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Ow!

304
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,820
Hey, what's a big idea?

305
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,720
What do you mean?

306
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,640
Don't give me that.

307
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,020
Just because the boss likes me.

308
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Have you gone nuts?

309
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Nuts to you!

310
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,400
No!

311
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
No!

312
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
I...

313
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,100
You could have gotten us all captured back
there, Ty.

314
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,800
You're so immature.

315
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
Could you yell a little quieter,
huh?

316
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,940
Gee, Sora, relax, kid.

317
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,620
Get a grip.

318
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,900
Who elected you the queen of the fun
police?

319
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,340
Yeah, this is tons of fun, and getting
caught will be a blast.

320
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:12,760
Couldn't you just pass notes?

321
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
It's much quieter.

322
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,900
This looks nasty.

323
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,760
We don't have to go through here,
do we?

324
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,045
This firewall's the
system's last line of defense,

325
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,561
but there appears to be
only one safe way through it.

326
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,420
And if we pick the wrong way, they'll
scoop us up with a spatula.

327
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,080
You're not scared, are you, Joe?

328
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,440
Maybe I am a little.

329
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,380
Relax, it's not like we're human or
anything.

330
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,440
We're just bunches of kilobytes,
remember?

331
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,640
The weak point should be...

332
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,660
here.

333
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:43,661
Cool.

334
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,500
Are you coming in, or are you just going
to stand there all day?

335
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,270
This is the host computer.

336
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,790
Yowza.

337
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,430
Do you think it comes with a CD-ROM drive,
or is that optional?

338
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,910
And what do you suppose that thing is?

339
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,070
I've heard of him.

340
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,690
His name's Datamon, a super-intelligent
robotic Digimon.

341
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:18,030
He disappeared without a trace some time
ago.

342
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,890
Nobody ever knew what happened to him.

343
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,350
Maybe that's the thing that sent us the
email.

344
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,046
It kind of looks like he's a prisoner.

345
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,870
Of course it was.

346
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,010
Who else?

347
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,070
Today is your lucky day.

348
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:28,930
And mine.

349
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,090
I get it.

350
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,810
He's communicating with us through the
infrared board on my laptop.

351
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:35,070
Oh, a hardware fan.

352
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,390
Well, listen, we haven't much time.

353
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,770
Long, long ago, I bought Etamon,
and lost.

354
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,190
One of my rare miscalculations.

355
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,410
Anyway, I was severely damaged,
and he imprisoned me here, and forced me

356
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,290
to act as his webmaster, administering his
network.

357
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,270
Without Etamon knowing, however,
I was able to slowly repair myself,

358
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:58,890
restoring my capabilities bit by bit over
the years.

359
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,150
Eventually, I gained control over Etamon's
network.

360
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,230
Not total control, but enough to bring
some misery to that blubbering baboon.

361
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,090
At last, I'm ready to free myself, but I
need your help to break the cyberlock.

362
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,590
What about my crest?

363
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,050
You said in your message that you could
lead us to it.

364
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,170
Um, yes, whatever you want.

365
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,390
Just please, help me out of here.

366
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,570
Can we trust this talking can opener?

367
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,150
Etamon is your enemy as well as mine.

368
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,590
That makes us allies.

369
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,410
Please, you're my only hope.

370
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,150
Okay, you're on.

371
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,210
What do you need from us?

372
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,490
I am transmitting instructions for
disengaging the cyberlock.

373
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,530
Hey, push that lever for me, would you,
Ty?

374
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,750
Got it.

375
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,370
Right three, left five.

376
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,130
Quickly, quickly, before Etamon returns!

377
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,590
Then push the button.

378
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,370
Okay, Ty, pull the lever back to its
original position.

379
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,270
That should be the last step in the
process.

380
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,450
Hold it.

381
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,710
Etamon!

382
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,630
I've been watching you on surveillance
cameras and you're an annoying little brat.

383
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,270
You know that?

384
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,030
Fucking troublemaker.

385
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,230
Hey, it's been my pleasure.

386
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,370
Great.

387
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,050
Why don't you just call him ugly,
too?

388
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,414
All this time, I thought it
was his snot-nosed kids

389
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,311
who were causing my
network to go on the fritz.

390
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,150
But it was you, wasn't it, you digital
dumpster?

391
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,710
Well, in a word, yes.

392
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,410
You rat!

393
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,090
Digibomb!

394
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,390
Help out!

395
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,690
Digibomb!

396
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,870
Digibomb!

397
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:23,250
Digibomb!

398
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:27,610
Ogilmon, digivolve
to... Rayman-on!

399
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,370
Tentermon, digivolve to...

400
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,070
Kabu-Kerry-mond!

401
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:43,190
Vealmon, digivolve
to... Verdramon!

402
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,890
Golemon, Digiball, too!

403
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,390
Digimon!

404
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,890
Digimon?

405
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,570
Huh?

406
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,450
I'm free!

407
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,930
Now let's see how you like it!

408
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,290
Huh?

409
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,850
Wee!

410
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,910
Ha-ha-ha!

411
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,750
Oh, Seelmon!

412
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,750
Hey, we set you free!

413
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,270
And I do appreciate that, you chumps!

414
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:13,310
Dumb kids!

415
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,550
You'll think by now they'll learn to trust
no one!

416
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,950
Trust me!

417
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,990
This will hurt!

418
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,530
Dark fat worm!

419
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,230
Beomond, over here!

420
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:28,950
Uh-oh!

421
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:28,950
Back!

422
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:28,950
Huh?

423
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,730
Well, so much for no fighting!

424
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,970
Beomond!

425
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,130
Tough luck!

426
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,230
Looks like I won again!

427
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,110
It's not over yet!

428
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,111
Mucky breath!

429
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,650
Just wait!

430
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,850
With their powers harnessed to my own,
I'll be more than a match for you!

431
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,070
Ha!

432
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,091
Come back here,
you bratty little... Sora!

433
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,950
Hi!

434
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,190
They've gone back out through the
firewall.

435
00:17:59,410 --> 00:17:59,670
Okay.

436
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,690
The weak point was here, right?

437
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,830
Wait a minute!

438
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,970
Let me get back online so I can find it!

439
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:06,610
We don't have time for that, Izzy!

440
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,030
What can happen?

441
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,430
This isn't the real me, right?

442
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,590
Don't test theories now!

443
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,870
Pain still hurts, Ty!

444
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,630
Hey!

445
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,190
Joe!

446
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,110
What are you thinking, Ty?

447
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,510
We're in a video game?

448
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,350
Nothing can happen to us because these
aren't our real selves here?

449
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,670
Yeah, something like that!

450
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:23,671
Well, think again!

451
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,130
Our digital selves are directly linked
with our other selves back home.

452
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,830
You need to be a lot more careful.

453
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,970
No telling what may happen.

454
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,690
You mean if I... If something
happens here... It... happens there?

455
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,370
I can't... move.

456
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,530
The weak point is one meter to your right!

457
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,270
No way!

458
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,290
Just one false move and it's over!

459
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,690
Hey, Ty!

460
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,190
It's safe, Ty!

461
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,990
We came through it all right on the way
in!

462
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,690
Yeah, but then I didn't know... that...

463
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,970
Go on!

464
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,030
It's okay!

465
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,870
Come on, Ty!

466
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,710
We're wasting time!

467
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,970
Sora needs us!

468
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,390
What's wrong with you?

469
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,950
Ty?

470
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,220
Sorry!

471
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
We held them!

472
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,760
As long as we could!

473
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,480
Now to finish off you kids and put an end
to your annoying interference!

474
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
What?

475
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,000
Would you care for some needle spray?

476
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,800
Howling blaster!

477
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,920
Come on, let's move!

478
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,740
Ty?

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
What's wrong with you?

480
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Come on!

481
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,960
No, not again!

482
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
They didn't get away again!

483
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm having an extremely bad day,
baby!

484
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,680
I don't get it!

485
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,940
When the creep grabbed
Sora and Biomon, why

486
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,280
didn't you go through
the firewall after them?

487
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,820
I couldn't... I couldn't move!

488
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
It's not your fault!

489
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,360
We're all in this together, Ty!

490
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,760
We'll find a way to get them back!

491
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
It's all my fault!

492
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,680
Sora!

493
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,460
It's all my fault!

494
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,370
No!

495
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,390
No!
