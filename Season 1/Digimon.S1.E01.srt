1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
Digimon!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Digital Monsters!

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,380
Digimon are the champions!

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,000
Change into Digital Champions to save the
digital world!

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,380
Digimon!

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,640
Digital Monsters!

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,060
Digimon are the champions!

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,620
Digimon is your champions!

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,930
Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
champions!

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's home.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,700
Planet Earth.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,260
But I'm not sure that's where I am right
now.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,080
Okay, let me back up a little.

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,600
It all began when the climate went
completely out of control.

15
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:16,599
The rainforest dried
out, and other places got

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,661
totally flooded with
oceans like chocolate sauce.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,580
And get this.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,280
Cities which were normally blazing hot in
the summer got super cold.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,900
At the time, I didn't know any of this was
going on because I was at camp.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,820
All of the other campers were,
you know, goofing off and hanging out.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,380
Me?

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,960
I was enjoying the summer sun while,
uh, going over my multiplication tables.

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,740
That is, until it started to snow in the
middle of July.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,920
Totally freaky.

25
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,300
And it gets weirder.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,980
You won't believe what happened to me and
six other kids.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,860
Oh, by the way, my name's Ty.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,000
Huh?

29
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
This is Sora.

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,860
She's okay, for a girl.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,780
Huh?

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,920
And Matt.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,440
Matt's too cool.

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,900
Just look at that haircut.

35
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,780
And this little kid is Izzy.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,980
He should have gone to computer camp.

37
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,540
Huh?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's Mimi.

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,740
I'll bet you can guess her favorite color
on the first try.

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,960
TK is Matt's dopey little brother.

41
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,980
Oh, and this is Joe.

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,320
But don't ever scare him.

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,860
He'd probably wet his pants.

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,511
So there we all were at camp, when suddenly
this huge blizzard came out of nowhere.

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,970
Needless to say, the canoe races were
cancelled.

46
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,270
So let's have toboggan races instead.

47
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,490
I'm gonna build the biggest snowman.

48
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,770
Hey TK, be careful.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,650
Slow down.

50
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,750
Brr.

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,850
It is freezing.

52
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,410
And I didn't bring a jacket.

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,030
Man, I was worried I'd catch a summer
cold.

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,090
But this is even worse.

55
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,010
Wow!

56
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,210
Why didn't I pack my fluffy pink snow
boots?

57
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,750
Still not working.

58
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,030
Bummer.

59
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,010
This storm's making a mess of my infrared
internet connection.

60
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,011
Look it!

61
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,310
Wow!

62
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,710
Hey, what's your name?

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,330
Izzy!

64
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,290
Come on out here!

65
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,390
You gotta see this!

66
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,070
Whoa!

67
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,310
Whoa!

68
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,070
It's beautiful!

69
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,450
Magical even!

70
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,690
Yeah.

71
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,290
Yeah?

72
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,470
What is it?

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,090
Maybe an aurora?

74
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,510
You mean aurora borealis, the northern
lights?

75
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,670
That's impossible.

76
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,890
You see that in Alaska.

77
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,550
We're way too far south.

78
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,370
Tell that to the snow.

79
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:31,370
I really think we ought to get back inside
before we all come down with pneumonia.

80
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,910
Miss this?

81
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,210
The sky is like short-circuiting.

82
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,570
Hey!

83
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,930
What's that?

84
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,150
Oh!

85
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,910
Do you think we need sunscreen?

86
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,430
Everyone, are you alright?

87
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,310
We're still here.

88
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,470
That was scary!

89
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,510
What?

90
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,650
What was it?

91
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,810
Meteors?

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,910
Oh!

93
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,330
Okay, so it's not meteors.

94
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,530
Huh?

95
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,210
Huh?

96
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,390
Huh?

97
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,550
Huh?

98
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:31,690
What?

99
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,130
Are these?

100
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,110
My guess is some sort of miniature remote
digital apparatus.

101
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,090
No instructions?

102
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,590
Get the instructions!

103
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,010
Surf's up!

104
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Woohoo!

105
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Ty!

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,640
Yeah, I'm okay.

107
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,470
Last

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,680
time I ate camp food.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey!

110
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,750
Just what are you?

111
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,890
Have you had your rabies shots?

112
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,870
Everything's gonna be alright now,
Ty!

113
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,410
I've been waiting for you!

114
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,210
Waiting for me?

115
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,190
My name's Coralmon.

116
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,310
And we're partners!

117
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,110
Coralmon?

118
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,150
That means...talking head?

119
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,650
Hmm.

120
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,030
It means brave little warrior.

121
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,350
And don't forget it, Ty!

122
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:56,470
So what did you mean you've been waiting
for me?

123
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,350
And how did you know my name?

124
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,050
Ty?

125
00:05:59,550 --> 00:05:59,870
Hmm?

126
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,190
Izzy, that you?

127
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,130
It's me.

128
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,970
And I've got this little pink thing
following me everywhere.

129
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,910
It is me, Multimon, at your service.

130
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,070
Anybody want lunch?

131
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,330
Another one?

132
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,930
What are they?

133
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,550
Oh, allow me to introduce myself.

134
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,810
My friends call me Multimon.

135
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,490
Everyone does, actually.

136
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,270
I believe those miniature remote digital
gadgets have taken on an actual life form.

137
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,550
I don't remember anything like this in the
camp brochure.

138
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,670
You think?

139
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,870
It's weird.

140
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,170
The vegetation is lush, but the soil
appears rather common.

141
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,170
Nothing is common in Digi World!

142
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,410
That's right, Ty!

143
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,770
You are in the Digi World!

144
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,050
And just where is the Digi World?

145
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,490
I don't care so much about where it is.

146
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,130
I will know what it is.

147
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,950
Guess I'll just take a look around for
myself.

148
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,250
The ocean?

149
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,710
What's that doing there?

150
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,210
Our campsite was nowhere near the ocean.

151
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,610
And I sure don't remember those mountains.

152
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,770
Hmm.

153
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,430
Something tells me a compass isn't gonna
help much.

154
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,410
Hey, Ty!

155
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,410
What do you see?

156
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:15,690
Nothing I recognize.

157
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,170
Huh?

158
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,210
Wait.

159
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,470
What's that?

160
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Look at that!

161
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,580
It's some sort of giant red beetle.

162
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,280
And it's flying right at us!

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
I can't watch.

164
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,080
That is one seriously bad Digimon even
when he's in good mood.

165
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
That's just great.

166
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,200
Watch out!

167
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:44,220
No!

168
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:44,840
No!

169
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,140
No!

170
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,320
No!

171
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,740
No!

172
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:47,741
His name is Quagamon.

173
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,500
He's an insectoid Digimon.

174
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,780
Vicious and ruthless.

175
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,020
With teeth like knives and scissor hands
that can chop through anything!

176
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,780
Who needs a gardener?

177
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Help!

178
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Ty, you okay?

179
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,340
Well, I have had better days.

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,500
Little guy, you should pick on bugs your
own size.

181
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
What's your name?

182
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,540
Coromod?

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
That's me.

184
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,340
You're pretty brave, for a little guy.

185
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm impressed.

186
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,880
It was nothing.

187
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,550
Here, quickly, everyone.

188
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,190
This way.

189
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,430
Come on.

190
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,650
Hurry up!

191
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,690
For having two long legs, you boys are
awfully slow.

192
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,010
Inside this tree!

193
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,750
Let's go!

194
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,130
What kind of tree is this?

195
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,790
It's a hiding tree, silly.

196
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:10,990
Quiet now!

197
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,190
Don't make a sound!

198
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
All clear!

199
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
No need to hide!

200
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,490
Sora!

201
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,310
You can come out now.

202
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,230
Oh, we were just planning the trap we were
gonna set for that big bug.

203
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,830
Huh?

204
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,770
I am enchanted to meet you, friends of
Sora!

205
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,450
Welcome!

206
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,830
I, Izzy, meet Yokomon.

207
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,550
My own personal something or other.

208
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,770
Looks kinda like a radish.

209
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,850
Must be another one of them.

210
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,070
Like the other.

211
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,770
Whatever they are.

212
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,970
Uh-oh.

213
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,350
They're popping up everywhere.

214
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,850
Hello!

215
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,150
I am Tokomon.

216
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,490
Hey, TK!

217
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,690
Over here!

218
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,270
Coming!

219
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,700
Come on, there you are!

220
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
TK!

221
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Hey, Matt!

222
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
You too?

223
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,500
Yeah, I'm here too.

224
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,900
No, I meant that under your arm.

225
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,880
Oh, this guy?

226
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,600
Yeah, well... Hello,
you appear pleasant.

227
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,980
Tsunomon is my name and I am quite pleased
to meet you.

228
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Help me!

229
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,820
This thing!

230
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,620
This thing!

231
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,140
It won't leave me alone!

232
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,440
Hey, who are you calling a thing?

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,280
A no-stuffed animal.

234
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,140
The name is Pokemon.

235
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,900
What's wrong with you guys?

236
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,860
Don't you see this creature hanging off
me?

237
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,960
And those creatures standing right there!

238
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,600
There!

239
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
They're everywhere!

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What are they?

241
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,220
We're...

242
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Digimon!

243
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,020
Digital monsters!

244
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,940
Digital monsters?

245
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes, Digimon!

246
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,960
We're not just digital monsters,
we're much more than that!

247
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
We're... kind of cute!

248
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,580
And... very loyal!

249
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,780
With beautiful hair!

250
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,380
Or maybe no hair at all!

251
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
We can be funny!

252
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Ha!

253
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,900
And... adorable!

254
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,620
It's a pleasure to meet each of you!

255
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,020
My name's Ty and these are my friends from
camp!

256
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,360
I'd like you to meet Sora!

257
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,360
Nice place you got here, except the bugs!

258
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,420
And the self-proclaimed cool one over
there is mad!

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,060
No autographs, please!

260
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,540
And this is Joe!

261
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,920
I'd shake hands, if you had me!

262
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,940
Izzy here's our computer expert!

263
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,700
Do you have internet access?

264
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,740
And last but not least,
this little guy is, uh... TK!

265
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Call me TK!

266
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,880
And I'm not as small as I look!

267
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,840
There now!

268
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Is that everybody?

269
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,740
Hey, what happened to that girl with the
funny pink hat?

270
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:14,060
Now, now, her name is Mimi.

271
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, perhaps she's off picking flowers.

272
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,720
Or going on a nature hike.

273
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,241
Or, uh... Come on!

274
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,700
Okay, so she's not picking flowers.

275
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,080
Mimi, where are you?

276
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
There she is!

277
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,400
Mimi, it's okay!

278
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,401
Mimi!

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,740
It's that big bug again!

280
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,740
Mimi, are you alright?

281
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,700
I think so.

282
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,500
Don't worry.

283
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,240
Tandamon's here to protect you.

284
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,320
It's okay now.

285
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Oh, sorry!

286
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,460
Watch it!

287
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,120
Here he comes!

288
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Run!

289
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,850
My mom is gonna want a complete and total
refund!

290
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,070
Here he comes again!

291
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,460
That does it!

292
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
No more running away!

293
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
What else can we do?

294
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,820
She's right!

295
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,880
There's no way we can fight that thing!

296
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,120
Not win, anyway.

297
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,540
Great!

298
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,260
Anybody bring a helicopter?

299
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
Be careful, Ty!

300
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,960
There's no way down.

301
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,300
We're going to have to find another way.

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,180
Another way where?

303
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Yoko-mon!

304
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,240
Yoko-mon!

305
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,740
Are you crazy?

306
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,380
Why'd you do it?

307
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,820
Sorry, it's just... I'm trying
to make a good impression.

308
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Crazy guy.

309
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,260
Oh... Yoko-mon!

310
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,740
Tandamon, talk to me!

311
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,920
They must be programmed for courage.

312
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,440
Tukumon, what's wrong?

313
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,280
Hey, Tsunumon, wake up!

314
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,860
Bukumon?

315
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
Wake up!

316
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Oh no!

317
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,230
Get back!

318
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,350
I

319
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,740
was hoping we'd seen the last of him!

320
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
Me too!

321
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,080
Guess he had other plans, huh?

322
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
I knew I should've brought my bug spread
out!

323
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,160
Okay, get ready to run!

324
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,960
No, we fight!

325
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,740
Huh?

326
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,320
That's right!

327
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,060
It's the only way!

328
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
Stand and fight!

329
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,040
Give it up, will ya?

330
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,820
No, Kuromon's right!

331
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,780
It's time that we showed what we're made
of!

332
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,580
No, don't!

333
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,460
They're right!

334
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
No way!

335
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,680
It's hopeless!

336
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,660
You're no match for him, Yoko-mon!

337
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,280
Let me go, let me go, let me go,
let me go, let me go!

338
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,636
Yes, we can get it, we can get it!

339
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,980
Let me go, let me go, let me go!

340
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Tanymon, you too?

341
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Uh-huh!

342
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry, Tai!

343
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Let's go!

344
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
It's useless!

345
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Yoko-mon!

346
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,480
Don't go-No, wait!

347
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,440
Don't do it, Zuma-mon!

348
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Don't go!

349
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,490
Be careful!

350
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,430
Uh-huh!

351
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,571
Toromon, digivolve
to... Iko-mon!

352
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,590
Yoko-mon!

353
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,490
Digivolve to...

354
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,870
Trio-mon!

355
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,831
Multimon, digivolve
to... Tento-mon!

356
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,911
Tsunomon, digivolve
to... Kabo-mon!

357
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:50,700
Tocomon, digivolve
to... Kabo-mon!

358
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,240
Look at them!

359
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,400
What's happened to the little guys?

360
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,481
They're... Bigger!

361
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,280
You asked for it!

362
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,240
Poison Ivy!

363
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,430
Lubbles!

364
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,910
Super Shocker!

365
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,910
Super Shocker!

366
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,911
Blue Blaster!

367
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,970
Marl Twister!

368
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,530
Rawr!

369
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,430
They made vaporware out of them.

370
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,110
Amazing!

371
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,270
Told you we could do it!

372
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,810
How about that Super Shocker?

373
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,070
Pretty wizard, huh?

374
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,071
Huh?

375
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,810
Watch out!

376
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
Guess we celebrated too soon!

377
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,820
So, just when we make some pretty cool
