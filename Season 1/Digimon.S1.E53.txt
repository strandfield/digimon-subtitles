00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
Even though we had two Megas on our side,
Piedmon still couldn't be beaten.


00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,080
We tried to escape by using his trapeze
things, and that was really scary.


00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,320
But not as scary as Piedmon turning
everyone into keychains.


00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,560
Kari and I were in real trouble, but I
stayed brave just like Matt told me to.


00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,800
Anjumon then became Magna Anjumon and
saved us and fixed the others.


00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,620
Piedmon attacked again, but we all
banished him into the Gate of Destiny.


00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,424
Afterward, Jedi said there
was a really evil force out


00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,000
there, but I'm pretty sure
I can face anything now.


00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:43,060
Did you know monsters?


00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,780
Did you know monsters?


00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,020
Did you know monsters?


00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,960
Did you know monsters?


00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:48,620
Did you know monsters?


00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,500
Did you know monsters?


00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,880
Did you know monsters?


00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:00,800
Did you know monsters?


00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,100
Did you know monsters?


00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,260
Did you know monsters?


00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:04,580
Did you know monsters?


00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
Did you know monsters?


00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,330
Spiral Mountain is disintegrating.


00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,550
Watch out!


00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,970
Are we down?


00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,830
Ty, are you alright?


00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,330
Yeah.


00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,470
Uh, this may be a stupid question.


00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,750
But how come we're not still falling?


00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,490
Huh?


00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,210
Greetings.


00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,910
I hope nobody needed a barf bag on the way
down.


00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:04,911
It's Jedi!


00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,870
So you're the one who brought us down
here.


00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,570
What do you want?


00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,990
We already beat the Dark Masters.


00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,973
It's true that the evil of the
Dark Masters was destroyed,


00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:14,450
but the source that
created that evil still exists.


00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,490
And that source came from the Wall of
Fire.


00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,490
What's that?


00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,970
When I was searching through the Dino
Runes, I came across an ancient inscription.


00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,670
It told of a time long
ago when a strange being


00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:29,590
appeared from behind the
Wall of Fire and it was angry.


00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,370
You would be too if you lived with that
kind of humidity.


00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,276
The mere existence of
this being caused a warp in


00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,710
space and time was thrown
completely out of whack.


00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,030
It threatened the collapse of the digital
world.


00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,870
And even worse than that, my new
wristwatch stopped working.


00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,530
The Digimon knew they didn't have the
strength to defeat this being,


00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,810
so the original Digi-destined children
were summoned from the real world,


00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,390
and together they defeated the evil.


00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,510
What?


00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,870
Then you mean that there were other kids
just like us before we came along?


00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:59,011
And we were summoned
because something else came


00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,391
out from behind that
Wall of Fire, didn't it?


00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,650
Huh.


00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,070
And that's the real enemy.


00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,630
That's correct.


00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,950
But unfortunately, that's just the good
news.


00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,633
The bad news is it also
told of a great darkness


00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:11,790
that will blanket the
entire digital world.


00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,030
A great darkness?


00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,630
Huh.


00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,590
Don't look now, but it's pretty dark.


00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,790
So is this the enemy?


00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,510
In a way, yes.


00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,870
But I believe he has a form as well.


00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:23,390
He's, uh, uh-oh.


00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,310
I'm out of quarters.


00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,910
Gotta go!


00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,850
Wait, Jedi!


00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,110
Come back!


00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,710
Next time I'll use a phone card,
I promise.


00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,570
See ya!


00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,830
Jedi!


00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,590
Oh, great.


00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,208
How does he expect
us to fight this thing when


00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,110
we don't even know
what it is we're looking for?


00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,970
Just my luck.


00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,410
The second I start enjoying my vacation,
another monster tries to destroy the world.


00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,760
Sorry, guys, but
something tells me this isn't


00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,271
gonna be like any other
Digimon we've ever run into.


00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,970
Yeah?


00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,590
So what?


00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,930
The first Digi-destined kids were able to
defeat something like this?


00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,010
Well, then, so will we.


00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,011
Mm-hmm.


00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,170
That's right.


00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,990
We'll just have to find a way to do it.


00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,990
Huh?


00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,350
What's that noise?


00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,530
Sounds like a moose.


00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,090
Sounds to me like it's coming from every
direction.


00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,850
Ah!


00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,110
Me too!


00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,530
But what does it mean?


00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,390
I know who you are.


00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,990
You don't have the power to eliminate my
sadness.


00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,510
Huh?


00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,710
Who's there?


00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,430
I'll bet this has something to do with
that Digimon gen I was talking about.


00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,890
Either that or it's a giant cube puzzle.


00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,380
I am the ultimate evil, complete with hot
and cold running water.


00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
What on earth is that thing?


00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,140
I am Apokalomon, a mutant Digimon.


00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,480
My darkness zone attack transforms my
enemy into nothingness.


00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
I have the power to turn everything I
touch into total darkness.


00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,840
Perhaps I will start with earth.


00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,020
I better get a new flashlight.


00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
But what about...


00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,120
The...


00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Kids!


00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,440
Sarum!


00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Or Mimi!


00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,280
Are you repulsed by my appearance?


00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,440
Don't be afraid to hurt my feelings.


00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
They're already hurt.


00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,880
You see, I was created from all that was
lost during the digivolting process.


00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,420
What do you mean by lost?


00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,280
Digimon have been digivolting for many
years now, over and over again.


00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,560
But there were some who weren't up to the
challenge and simply disappeared.


00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
That makes sense.


00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,260
Even on earth, some species became extinct
during the process of evolution.


00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:37,081
In fact, the Tasmanian tiger
wolf was one of those... Silence!


00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,280
Who's the one telling this story anyway?


00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,060
Me or you?


00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,400
Alright, go ahead.


00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,080
First, I have a question to ask.


00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,900
Do you believe that I am worthy of
coexisting with you?


00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,040
Uh, well... yeah, sure.


00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Oh, really?


00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,835
Even though I was forged from
the pain and misery of all the


00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:58,480
ill-fated Digimon who vanished
while attempting to digivolve?


00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,040
You're entirely made up of grief and
sorrow.


00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,120
How sad for you.


00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,520
Sure, rub it in.


00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,505
And now, Digi-Destined
and Digimon, I have


00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:09,901
been waiting an eternity
for this encounter.


00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,680
What?


00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,100
What do you mean?


00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,680
As I sat alone in the cold, miserable
darkness of my world, I watched all of you


00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,560
on the other side, laughing and having fun
in the light.


00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,420
Well, now it's my turn... to shine!


00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,380
Is everybody okay?


00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,580
I think so.


00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:33,200
Yeah.


00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm okay, Tai.


00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Not for long.


00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,320
Do you think it's fair that I should have
to live with all this agony?


00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,820
Why should you get to laugh when I am
forced to cry?


00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,875
Why do you get to
taste the best life has to


00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:49,001
offer while all I do is
choke on its leftovers?


00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
Answer me this!


00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Why do all of you get the pizza while I
get the crust?


00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,060
Oh, I can't take all these metaphors!


00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,920
Boy, this guy really holds a grudge.


00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,897
I will rule the world and
plunge it into darkness so


00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:04,680
that I don't have to be
alone anymore in my misery!


00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,240
Wait a minute, what am I laughing at?


00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,720
I'm supposed to be depressed!


00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,520
River of Power!


00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
Hurry!


00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Ah!


00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,400
Ah!


00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:19,940
Ah!


00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:19,980
Ah!


00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,380
Oh, no!


00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,060
That was Metal Seedramon with his classic
River of Power!


00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,880
And now, here's Lyotismon with his number
one hit!


00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
Crimson Lightning!


00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
Ah!


00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Ah!


00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Ah!


00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,080
Machine-dramon, giga-canonite!


00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,960
Inconceivable!


00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,280
He's using all the attacks of the evil
Digimon we've defeated in the past!


00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
You mean we have to fight them all over
again?


00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,900
This is the worst recurring nightmare I've
ever been awake for!


00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,320
Hey, we were able to beat them once!


00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,300
Sora's right!


00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,560
We did beat them!


00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,840
And we can do it again!


00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,220
We just have to fight together as a team!


00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,860
I agree.


00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,020
We've sacrificed too much to give up now.


00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:03,220
You fools!


00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,540
You haven't even seen my true power yet!


00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,040
Reverse Digivolve!


00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,080
I'll make you understand how it feels to
be one step closer to extinction!


00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,300
They're rookies!


00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,440
He changed them back so easily!


00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,900
I'm sorry, TK!


00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,020
It's not your fault, Paddlemon,
it's his!


00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,800
Great.


00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,320
This time, we're finished.


00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,420
You better lose that chewed, Kari!


00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,581
Just because we're at the rookie level
doesn't mean we still can't fight!


00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,240
We Digivolve if we have the energy!


00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:45,940
That's it!


00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,780
Start from scratch!


00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can Digivolve again!


00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,440
We'd have to eat something!


00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,360
Come to think of it, I am kind of hungry!


00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Forget food!


00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,340
We have the power within us!


00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,880
But we need your help!


00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah!


00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Mm-hmm!


00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,120
Mm-hmm!


00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,420
Everybody get your crests ready!


00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Deathclaw!


00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Ah!


00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Ah!


00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Ah!


00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,630
Ah!


00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,310
Ah!


00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,670
Our crests in Tans!


00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,150
He broke them all!


00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,010
They won't be able to Digivolve without
them!


00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,530
I hope you learned your lesson!


00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,890
Always save your receipts!


00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,050
The warranty was probably still good on
those things!


00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,250
Isn't this usually the time when one of us
comes up with a brilliant idea?


00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,810
I don't think anything can save us this
time, Joe!


00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,270
I'm afraid we're done for!


00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,790
How can we fight Apokalomon without
Digivolving?


00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
There's no way!


00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,101
All the rookie Digimon combined
couldn't defeat an enemy


00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,830
who has the power of all
the evil Digimon from the past!


00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,290
How can you be so sure?


00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,690
There's got to be a way somehow!


00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,970
How did the original Digi-Destined kids
defeat this enemy?


00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,870
I'll take these children and use their
fear to make them digital and disappear!


00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,070
What's this?


00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,850
Fascinating!


00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,430
Our bodies are being broken down into
little bits of digital information!


00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,950
Fascinating!


00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,690
Let's stay calm, everyone!


00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,910
Don't fall to pieces!


00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,170
Too late!


00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Where are we?


00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,440
We're information now!


00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,700
This is where all digital information
gathers!


00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,940
It's the world of data!


00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,640
Data?


00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,160
I'm too young to be dating!


00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
It's not the same.


00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,020
Sometimes too much information's a bad
thing.


00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,420
Can we get back?


00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
I don't know, Kari.


00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,660
Nothing like this has ever happened to us
before.


00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I don't know what to do.


00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,580
Is this it?


00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,500
Have we lost?


00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,240
I'd say that's a pretty good conclusion.


00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,360
Come on, you guys!


00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,100
Don't quit now!


00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,840
Why not?


00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,440
Look, we can't stop fighting now just
because of a little setback.


00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,200
So what with bits of information?


00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,476
We have no tags and
crests, we can't digivolve, and


00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,760
we're facing the most
powerful enemy of all time.


00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,180
I don't see what the problem is.


00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,960
Listen, Biomon.


00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
You guys have a great attitude about this
whole thing.


00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,905
But all the positive thinking
in the world can't guarantee


00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:13,160
that we'll find a way to get
back to our original forms.


00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:16,380
I tried positive thinking once,
and I was positive about one thing.


00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,820
I positively hated it.


00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,080
Speaking scientifically, we're the first
humans to be digitally processed.


00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,580
Technically, we're pioneers, like Marco
Polo.


00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
Oh, I know what he's famous for.


00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:26,820
Marco!


00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,620
Polo!


00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,180
Marco!


00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:28,880
Polo!


00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
Marco!


00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,740
Huh?


00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,800
In every battle, you're bound to face a
number of unknowns.


00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,168
Yeah, you didn't know
how those other fights would


00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,381
turn out, but you fought
them anyway, didn't you?


00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,300
Yeah, that's right.


00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
We did fight.


00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,840
When I first got to the digital world, I
was afraid of any little thing that moved.


00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,460
We faced all kinds of new monsters.


00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,121
But no matter who they threw
at us, we always found the


00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:51,800
strength to beat the enemy,
regardless of how big it was.


00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,560
Didn't we, Joe?


00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,020
That's right, we did.


00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,740
We worked together as a team.


00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,040
Even that time when we almost lost TK
because he couldn't swim.


00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,860
Of course, I forgot that I couldn't swim
either.


00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,800
I remember times when all I wanted to do
was break down and cry.


00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,260
But instead, you fought on with your new
friends.


00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:11,640
Hmm.


00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,800
I feel like I've become a stronger person
since I met all of you.


00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,220
Like that time at the convention center
when all those Bakuman were attacking.


00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,840
I didn't cry a single drop.


00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,440
All right, maybe just one drop.


00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,360
Before I met you, TK, I didn't think it
mattered if I ever digivolved or not.


00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:33,560
When Devimon went to grab you and got me,
I knew it was my time to shine.


00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,060
I became Angemon for the first time and
I've been flying high ever since.


00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,820
I learned something from you too,
Patamon.


00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,840
I learned that sometimes you have to fight
for what you believe in.


00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,920
I want you to know you've changed my life
in many ways too, Sora.


00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,460
Really?


00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,100
Of course you have.


00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
After all, I've never had a best friend
before.


00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,160
I would do anything for you.


00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:59,120
Like that time I took my Angemon's Crimson
Lightning attached right in the chest.


00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,160
Talk about a heartburn.


00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,202
You know, Izzy, when
I first met you, I thought


00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,120
you were just one of
those computer geeks.


00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,660
But after I got to know you, I realized
you are one of those computer geeks.


00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,380
And I'm glad you are, because where would
the rest of us be without you?


00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
Thanks, pal.


00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,040
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.


00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,260
Although I wanted to cry when I felt that
asteroid belt tightening around my waist,


00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,480
but you and I took care of Edamon
together.


00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,541
As for you, Matt... You
don't have to say anything.


00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,160
I know.


00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,740
There was that time
when... Yeah, that's right.


00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,320
I remember.


00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,980
And then you and I... I know.


00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,840
Remember when we...
Didn't you hear me?


00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,520
I said you don't have to say anything.


00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,780
You and I knew from the beginning that
together we made an invincible team,


00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,400
right, Ty?


00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,840
You got that right.


00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,040
Of course, I probably could have taken
care of Edamon without you.


00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,060
But it was nice having you around.


00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,020
You did get me out of a few jams.


00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,940
We can't give up now.


00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,880
Because if we do, what was the whole point
of searching for Kari in the first place?


00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,880
Goto, Mon.


00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,760
I've waited my whole life to meet you and
find my purpose.


00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,260
And that is to protect you no matter what
the cost.


00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,120
Whether that meant facing Myotismon's
prisonly wing attack...


00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,200
...or facing the reality of losing
Wizardmon.


00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,060
You know, I will always be there for you.


00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,620
Boy, if I had never met you, Gatomon.


00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,620
And if I had never come to the digital
world...


00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:29,580
And if none of us became friends in the
first place...


00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,040
Then we wouldn't have become the people
that we are today.


00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,260
You're right.


00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,996
And we never would have won all those
battles without each other.


00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,740
I feel like I've grown up a lot.


00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,220
I think we've all grown up in a lot of
ways.


00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,880
I've grown up too.


00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,420
I'm a much better fighter now.


00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,040
You can do it!


00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,000
Come on, for Earth!


00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,100
We're so proud of you, no matter what
happens!


00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,500
Give it your all.


00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,560
I don't know about you, but I'm not ready
to quit yet!


00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
I'm with you, Tai.


00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,540
I won't let this whole experience be for
nothing.


00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Me neither.


00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,220
There is no way I'm about to let my
friends down.


00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,300
And besides, there are still a lot of
people counting on us down on Earth.


00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,840
Let's find a way!


00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Let's fight!


00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
We're ready!


00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,700
We've reached the point where there's no
turning back!


00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,780
Crests or no crests, we're going to win!


00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Are we together?


00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
We are!


00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Then let's fight!


00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,380
It's gonna be pretty tough without our
crests.


00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,040
Crests?


00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,680
We don't need no stinking crests!


00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,780
What?


00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
My heart!


00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,930
It's your crests!


00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,988
You don't need to carry
them anymore because their


00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:57,251
power has been inside
of you this whole time!


00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,890
You mean like, in our hearts?


00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,810
Prodigious!


00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,930
That makes perfect sense.


00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,350
It's like my knowledge and Joe's sense of
responsibility.


00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,721
If your special traits are
within you, then you don't need


00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:09,090
your crest because your
power will be within you as well!


00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,950
You're wrong!


00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,510
Huh?


00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,710
It wasn't the friendship inside of me that
made my crest glow, Izzy.


00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,790
It was more than that.


00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,216
The friendship I felt from
all of you gathered inside my


00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:19,510
heart, and that brought
the power of my crest to life.


00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,910
So each person's crest isn't powered by
themselves.


00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,710
It's powered by the faith we have in each
other.


00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,350
Then the light inside of me is for
everyone!


00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,220
And everyone's hopes are my hopes!


00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,530
Anjaman!


00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,530
Anjaman Digiball 2!


00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,560
Knowledge!


00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,560
Sentiment Digiball


00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,240

00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,660
Togamon Digiball 2!


00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,661
Meant Dogooro!


00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,570
Re-liability!


00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,830
The Arf!


00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,550
inhabit Dogoo route!


00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:14,640
The bockyouro route!


00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,860
Out.�� credo route!


00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Wow!
