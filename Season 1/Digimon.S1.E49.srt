1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
We were crossing yet another desert when
Kari got sick and collapsed.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,649
Tai kind of freaked out
because it seems that when they

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,180
were younger, she almost
died, and Tai blames himself.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,480
We soon discovered a deserted city,
and while Sora and TK watched over Kari,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,280
Tai and I went in search of medicine.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,420
Machindramon and his goons were tracking
our every move, and on our way back from

7
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:20,820
the hospital, we just barely escaped
annihilation.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,726
When we finally rejoined
the others, Machindramon

9
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,100
showed up and imploded
the building we were hiding in.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,780
Could things get any worse?

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,360
Probably.

12
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,120
How long do humans usually sleep when
they're sick, TK?

13
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:32,680
It's tough to say for sure, Gatoman,
but I'd guess anywhere between eight hours

14
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,620
and eight years, give or take a minute or
so.

15
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,880
Wow, then considering how high her fever
is, we'd better get comfortable.

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,100
I wish one of the older kids were here.

17
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,120
I bet they'd know how to wake her up.

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,960
You'll think of something, TK.

19
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,460
See?

20
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,900
I knew you'd think of something.

21
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm still not sure that woke her.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,080
Huh?

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,480
I could be wrong.

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,540
Hi, Kari.

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Hit the snooze button.

26
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,580
Hmm, one more time.

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Please.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
You've slept enough.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,380
How do you feel?

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,980
I think my fever's gone.

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,280
So, how long was I asleep for?

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,593
Let's just say that
when you fell asleep, I

33
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,800
had nine lives, and now
I'm down to only three.

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,220
Where is everybody?

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Hmm.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,340
Hey!

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I hear Patamon!

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,220
I wonder if he's found anyone.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Oh.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,400
Who's that with Patamon?

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,820
It's Biamon!

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
And Sora!

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Kari, you're awake.

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,180
You look so much better.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,800
Have you seen Ty and the others?

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Mm-mm.

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,460
I looked everywhere, but couldn't find
them.

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,060
Ty!

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Help me, Ty!

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Kari!

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,660
My guess is that when we all fell,
Ty and Izzy landed somewhere else.

52
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,140
I hope they're all right.

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,640
Don't worry, Kari.

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh, I almost forgot.

55
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,700
Look what Biamon found.

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,540
I'm sure it's the medicine Ty went to find
for you.

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,260
Why don't you keep it in case your fever
comes back?

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,740
You can use it as a reminder of how much
Ty loves you.

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,020
This place has a lot of twists and turns
to it.

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm sure if we all look together,
we'll have no problem finding the others.

61
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,240
Right!

62
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,680
We'll work as a team!

63
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,640
Yeah.

64
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,960
I'll try to be strong enough to help,
too.

65
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,600
After all, Ty would do the same for me.

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,820
This place is like a museum of the famous
sewer systems of the world.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,460
I'll pass on Yoder Exhibit.

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,720
Heh!

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,980
Too late for that!

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Stop!

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Huh?

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,780
Listen, do you guys hear something?

73
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,440
Yeah, I can hear it now, too.

74
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,220
What do you think it could be?

75
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,740
I don't know, but it sounds like it's
coming from over there.

76
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,980
Let's take a look.

77
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,700
Work!

78
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,720
Work!

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Keep working or else!

80
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,220
I said work, you lazy Noomomond!

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,040
Golly!

82
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,120
You slimy Noomomond make me sick!

83
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,040
If you didn't have such a weakness to
sunlight, we wouldn't have to keep you

84
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,160
working underground to power Machinderbond
City on Spiral Mountain!

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
You deserve to live in the sewers!

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Now get back to work before I really get
mad!

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Isn't that Monzeemon?

88
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,240
What happened to him?

89
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,560
He used to be so cuddly!

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,220
That's not Monzeemon, TK!

91
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,600
That's Waru Monzeemon!

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,260
Monzeemon was sweet and cute, but Waru
Monzeemon is about as cuddly as a porcupine!

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,480
His bear paw will give you heartburn,
along with his heartbreak attack!

94
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,700
Big meanie!

95
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,420
He's torturing those poor Noomomon down
there!

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,220
How can one kind of Puppet Digimon be so
nice while another can be so evil?

97
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,440
I've been too hard on you guys!

98
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,240
You need a break!

99
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Okay, break's over!

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
If we had more power...

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,320
Sorry!

102
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:43,960
What happened?

103
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,100
Did she get sick again?

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,580
What's going on here?

105
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,160
Get back to work!

106
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,040
Huh?

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,340
The Digi-Destined?

108
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,160
He knows we're here!

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed!

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Run!

111
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,540
And here they are now!

112
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,770
Gatomon, please leave me here.

113
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,170
I need to free the Noomomon from their
chains.

114
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,330
Do you understand?

115
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,630
I guess so.

116
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,870
Catch us if you can, you big throw-run!

117
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,130
I'll get you!

118
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,090
Noomomon Digivolve 2!

119
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,091
Hey!

120
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm on Digivolve 2!

121
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,320
Wait a second, I'm still me!

122
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
You guys must be low on energy!

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,180
What do we do now, Sora?

124
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,220
Running comes to mind!

125
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Wait!

126
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,450
We'll wait for Digi-Destined!

127
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,470
Sora, something wonderful is happening to
me!

128
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,390
I've never been able to fly this fast
before!

129
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,070
Me too!

130
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,310
Watch me go!

131
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:27,930
Faster!

132
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,370
Fast!

133
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:28,830
Attack!

134
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,204
I don't care what you're
faster than, as long as

135
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,770
you're faster than a
gigantic rolling teddy bear!

136
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,630
Queen Kari!

137
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,730
Queen Kari!

138
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,830
Queen Kari!

139
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,010
Queen Kari!

140
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,090
The Noomomon think you're...their queen!

141
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,590
Queen Kari!

142
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,690
Queen Kari!

143
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,140
Queen Kari!

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,440
Queen Kari!

145
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:00,640
Queen Kari!

146
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,020
Queen Kari!

147
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:02,040
Queen Kari!

148
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,340
Queen Kari!

149
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm back!

150
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Han, what are you doing out here?

151
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,760
Isn't it time for your flogging?

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,040
Don't just sit there, staring!

153
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,960
Get back to work!

154
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,820
Hey!

155
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,540
Who cut your chains off?

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I did.

157
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Got a problem?

158
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
Kari, no!

159
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
You're through!

160
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,000
Get off of me, you green blobs of sludge!

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,556
I'll beat the scuffing out of you!

162
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,580
No, Maman.

163
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Kari!

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,860
You really think you have a chance against
me?

165
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,340
Come on!

166
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,520
Give it your best shot!

167
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,980
This is easier than swatting Digi-Fly!

168
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
Heartbreak attack!

169
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
No!

170
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,960
Where's that light coming from?

171
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Kari!

172
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
What's happening?

173
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm surging with energy!

174
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,620
Quick, get me a scratching post!

175
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:25,970
Boys and girls!

176
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,670
Oh, gang-ing up, huh?

177
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,090
I'll put you to work, too!

178
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,470
What do you think of that?

179
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,770
Meteor, away!

180
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,890
And a fake!

181
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,891
Hey!

182
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,330
Ugh!

183
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,250
No more chains, new Maman.

184
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,230
They're cute when they're not so slimy!

185
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,110
I love you, Queen Kari!

186
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,510
You're sweet!

187
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,850
That light again!

188
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,810
Look at it!

189
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,390
My light will guide us towards the others.

190
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,250
Hm?

191
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,758
Don't look at me, but I
think it's like this night light

192
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,830
I used to have that guided
me towards the bathroom!

193
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:10,270
Oh!

194
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,890
Well, Kari, I hope your light doesn't run
out of batteries!

195
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,550
Hm...

196
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,690
I'll lead the way.

197
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,990
Follow me!

198
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,470
Well, you see, Lord Machine German,
it's actually a pretty funny story!

199
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,670
Stop stalling and tell me what happened,
Waru Manziman.

200
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,450
That is, while you are still able to talk.

201
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,890
Yes, your middle-ness!

202
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,050
You see, I found the Digi Destin!

203
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,430
They were in your area!

204
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,350
Yes, and I was going to capture them for
you too, but this one little girl was

205
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:45,490
really strong, and then the new one were
biting me and it was really bad!

206
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,870
Enough!

207
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,950
If you thought that puny little girl was
tough, wait till I get through with you.

208
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,830
Why didn't you alert me, you stupid
carnival prize?

209
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,350
I wanted to tell you sooner, but they
wounded me!

210
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,510
Look at my owies and boo-boos!

211
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,110
I'm sorry, I should be more sympathetic
after your grueling battle.

212
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,730
Let me reward you for helping me locate
the Digi Destined.

213
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,731
Hey!

214
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,950
He shot my paw!

215
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,970
Cory!

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,640
Agamon, what are you doing laying down at
a time like this?

217
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,540
Sorry, Ty.

218
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I'll try to keep up.

219
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
You know, Ty, that's the fifth time he's
collapsed.

220
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,860
Call me crazy, but I think maybe we should
rest for a little while.

221
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Hmm.

222
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Cory!

223
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,820
That's right.

224
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,160
Just let our Digimon die.

225
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,400
Huh?

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,060
Oh, sorry guys.

227
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,400
It's just a figure of speech.

228
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm pretty tired too, Ty.

229
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,800
Why don't we rest?

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,580
Then we can commence our search again.

231
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,960
Please don't provoke him, Izzy!

232
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,240
Don't you understand?

233
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,300
Kari's sick.

234
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,620
We have to find her.

235
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
I know that, Ty, but she's not here right
now.

236
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,900
That's my point!

237
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,500
We have to find her now!

238
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,980
Calm down, Ty.

239
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm warning you, Ty.

240
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,240
You better stop giving us orders or else.

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,300
Or else what?

242
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,460
I didn't plan anything after or else.

243
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,840
I just thought it sounded tough.

244
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,080
You want to see tough?

245
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
Here's tough!

246
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,700
Izzy, did you hear that?

247
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,420
Huh?

248
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,340
Just listen.

249
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,260
Getting closer.

250
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:24,960
Footsteps.

251
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,640
All I hear is my head pounding.

252
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Someone's here.

253
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,780
You think he's been following us?

254
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,180
Maybe.

255
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,976
Let's pretend to keep fighting and we'll
hide behind that gate.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,700
Okay, but just make sure your next
punch... is pretend too.

257
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,400
Better stop calling me names!

258
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,060
I will not!

259
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,200
You're a bully and a... a ruffian!

260
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,556
That's the best you could come up with?

261
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,960
Yes, on such short notice.

262
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Take that!

263
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,530
Do you think it could be one of
Machinedramund's guys?

264
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,750
It's possible.

265
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,870
Should we?

266
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,150
Digivolve?

267
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,230
Yes.

268
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,730
Not a bad idea.

269
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,510
Systemon!

270
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,630
Digivolve 2!

271
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:10,690
Kaboom!

272
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,950
Never mind!

273
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,670
Abumon!

274
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:14,671
Digivolve 2!

275
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,950
Robot!

276
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,630
Abumon,

277
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,140
your Digivolve was a digi-dud.

278
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,940
Your energy levels are too low.

279
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
Izzy, I'm sorry.

280
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
It's okay, Ty.

281
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,060
I know your original intention wasn't to
punch me.

282
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,920
You were worried about Kari, that's all.

283
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
What's fair is fair.

284
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,280
I want you to hit me right now.

285
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,000
That's ridiculous!

286
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I won't resort to that.

287
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,836
Nothing can be settled with violence.

288
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,900
I'm not gonna hit you, Ty.

289
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Can I hit you then?

290
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,920
I wouldn't mind to swipe myself.

291
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
Okay.

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,140
I get it.

293
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
Here he comes!

294
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:55,900
Andromon!

295
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,460
I remember now!

296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,460
We met Andromon on Fire Island.

297
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,280
He was the android Digimon who had a black
gear stuck in his mechanism, but we

298
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,520
removed it and freed him of its evil
spell.

299
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,800
I wasn't sure if it was you or not.

300
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,560
Well, it's nice to see a friendly face.

301
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,100
Even if it is made of metal.

302
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
What are you doing down here anyway,
Andromon?

303
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,720
And why are you sneaking up on people?

304
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:19,060
I'm trying to put together a resistance
army against Machinedramon.

305
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,180
I've heard rumors that Digimon are hiding
in the sewers.

306
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,660
They fled here when Machinedramon burned
the cities.

307
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,760
I've come to the sewers to organize them.

308
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,380
And while I'm here, I'm going to fix that
drip.

309
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,100
I thought you were spies sent here by
Machinedramon to destroy my plans.

310
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,660
How insulting!

311
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:41,720
Kari?

313
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,440
We're looking for my little sister named
Kari.

314
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,120
She's sick.

315
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Have you seen her?

316
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,760
Sora, Biomon, TK, and Panamon are probably
with her too.

317
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,820
You mean... Queen Kari is your sister?

318
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,320
Queen?

319
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,620
Wait just a moment!

320
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
They're coming!

321
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,480
Kari and the others are coming here?

322
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
When?

323
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,280
Now!

324
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,020
Really?

325
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,540
Prodigis, Andromon!

326
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,580
Oh good.

327
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,200
Just what I was looking for.

328
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
Victims.

329
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,820
Machinedramon!

330
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,700
Hello, Andromon.

331
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,600
Babysitting?

332
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll destroy you first while the others
watch.

333
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,840
I'll hold him off.

334
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,780
You hide!

335
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Careful!

336
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Andromon!

337
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,420
What is it, Kari?

338
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
They're coming.

339
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
You mean die?

340
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,640
When?

341
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Now!

342
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Machinedramon!

343
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,250
Sora, TK!

344
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,150
Kari!

345
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,670
She made it!

346
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,830
Was that Andromon I saw fighting with
Machinedramon?

347
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,090
That's him all right.

348
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,730
He's sacrificing himself to protect us.

349
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,170
Oh!

350
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,070
He's raising an army against
Machinedramon!

351
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,730
Dragonfire!

352
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,870
Are you all right, Andromon?

353
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,930
Yes, thank you.

354
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,070
We'll take you to safety.

355
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:34,870
No!

356
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,110
Let's fight Machinedramon together!

357
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,890
Meteor away!

358
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:42,950
The Celestial Arrow!

359
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,990
The Celestial Arrow!

360
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:45,530
End of fate!

361
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,210
End of fate!

362
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,610
Machinedramon's a megadigimon!

363
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,070
They can't win!

364
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,170
Gigacannon!

365
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,290
Gigacannon!

366
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,760
They weren't even worth my time.

367
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,200
You're next!

368
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,410
Who wants to be the first victim?

369
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Kari!

370
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,340
How brave you are to volunteer.

371
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,660
I'll try to make this as painful as I can.

372
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,560
What do you think you are doing,
Noomomon?

373
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,440
Noomomon?

374
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,820
Do you slightly digimon call this
fighting?

375
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,160
Noomomon!

376
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Gigacannon!

377
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,740
Oh, Noomomon!

378
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
Uh!

379
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,780
Oh!

380
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,400
I feel the power!

381
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,100
Gigimon!

382
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:09,640
Digital Monsters!

383
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,000
Digimon are the champions!

384
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,460
Digimon!

385
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Digital Monsters!

386
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,980
Digimon are the champions!

387
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
What?

388
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,940
Dwarf!

389
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,180
Digimon!

390
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,570
Digimon!

391
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,010
Digital Monsters!

392
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,130
Wargreymon!

393
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,170
Digimon, digital monsters, Digimon.

394
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,770
Wake up!

395
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,730
We'll

396
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,240
finish you once and for all.

397
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,940
I don't think so.

398
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,580
You missed what I did as Wargreymon.

399
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,780
I sliced you like an onion.

400
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,410
Without Mashidramon, this area has become
unstable.

401
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,410
It's beginning to fall apart.

402
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,810
Nothing can happen to us that we can't
handle together.

403
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,430
Right.

404
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,430
I think it's becoming a little too
dangerous.

405
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,910
We better get out of here.

406
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,210
You're right.

407
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,470
Let's go.

408
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,300
Mashidramon City is dissolving.

409
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,180
My work here is finished.

410
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,120
Farewell, Andramon.

411
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Thank you.

412
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,230
When we get down, can I build one of those
memorials to my friend, the Numomon?

413
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,130
Sure.

414
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,870
We'll all help build it.

415
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,430
Right, guys?

416
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,910
Yeah.

417
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,930
You're next, Piedmon.

418
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,950
Will the Digidestined be able to defeat
the most powerful Dark Master of all?

419
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:19,930
Find out their fate on the next Digimon
Digital Monsters.
