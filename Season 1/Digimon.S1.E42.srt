1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,336
Pixiemon was unable to
fight off all of the Dark Masters,

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,520
but we were grateful to
him and his noble defeat.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,880
Sometime later, we were on our way to what
we thought was a beach picnic,

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,780
but it turned out to be a track set up by
Scorpiomon.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,280
With most of the group unconscious,
it was up to us to rescue them.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,584
Xudomon and Lillimon allowed
us to get the gang out of the

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,360
hut just as Metal Seedramon
was blasting it into rubble.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,980
We escaped into the ocean on Xudomon's
back.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,520
At least, we thought we got away.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,160
Xudomon and Lillimon's back.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:55,790
Ding on Digital Monsters Change into
Digital Champions To Save the Digital

12
00:00:55,791 --> 00:01:00,450
World Digimon, Digital Monsters,
Digimon are the kindergarten.

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,730
Digimon, Digital Monsters, Digimon are the
chumpkins.

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,470
Digimon, out your captain

15
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,690
of monsters, Digimon.

16
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,730
A river of power!

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,000
You're finished, you upstart
Digi-destined.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,140
In a word, you're sucked!

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Huh?

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,840
Who is that?

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,660
It's Waymon!

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
I

23
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,230
never thought I'd want to be fish food,
but we'll be safe in here.

24
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,430
Technically, it's

25
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,290
a...

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,640
You escaped this time, but you've escaped
for the last time!

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,940
Why did Waymon stick his spout in my
business and save the Digi-destined?

28
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,520
What are you doing here, Divermon?

29
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,480
We just came up for a little air!

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,880
Those Divermon, if it wasn't for their
striking fish attack, they'd be useless to me.

31
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
No matter.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,680
Wherever those kids try to hide,
I'll find them.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,092
I rule this ocean with
an iron hand, an iron

34
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,260
tail, and an iron
everything for that matter.

35
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,140
I'll catch them even with Waymon on their
side.

36
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,360
Well, don't just sit there treading water.

37
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,300
I told you, go find those kids!

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Aye, aye, sir!

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,700
Thanks for saving us, Waymon!

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,080
Aw, don't mention it.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,060
No, seriously, don't mention it.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
I don't want it to get around.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Hey, guys!

44
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,900
We still have a problem.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,320
How are we gonna be able to defeat the
Dark Masters?

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,880
I wonder how they took over the digital
world in the first place.

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
Do you remember, Waymon?

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
Of course I remember, Waymon.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,920
Big fella.

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Snappy dresser.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,260
Oh, you mean the Dark Masters?

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,780
I don't know all the details, but soon
after the digital world began to warp,

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,440
Metal Seedramon began to take over the
ocean.

54
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,140
Darn!

55
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,640
Ow!

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,900
Oh, uh, sorry, Waymon.

57
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,420
Ty, don't get upset.

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,900
We'll fix things.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
You're right.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
We'll do it.

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,580
We've done it before, haven't we?

62
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah!

63
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
That's the attitude.

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,979
I'll find a safe place for you
outside of Metal Seedramon's

65
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,380
reach, even if I have to swim
to the far corners of the ocean.

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,960
By the way, did I mention I charge by the
mile?

67
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,220
No!

68
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,221
No!

69
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,640
No!

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
No!

71
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
No!

72
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,380
No!

73
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:34,900
Can'ts land on their feet, but we still
need to eat.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,720
It's Gatoman's wish for some fresh flying
fish, cause I'm a kitty.

75
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,540
A kitty kitty.

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Whoa!

77
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh!

78
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,910
That's great, Gatoman, but the rest of us
have to eat too.

79
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,550
Stand aside and watch how a pro does it.

80
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,570
Hmmm... Point ivy!

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
They're served!

82
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,950
Why'd you stop playing, Matt?

83
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,690
Oh, that song is just too depressing.

84
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,270
It always gives me the blues.

85
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:24,750
Besides, I can't stop thinking about the
Dark Masters.

86
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,810
They're different than any Digimon we've
ever faced before.

87
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,070
Well, I've analyzed the situation, and I
believe we can defeat them with WarGreymon.

88
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:33,370
Huh?

89
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,090
He's a Draymon Destroyer.

90
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,890
Draymon Destroyer?

91
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,230
Try speaking English.

92
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,370
Well, you see, the weapons on WarGreymon's
arms are the key.

93
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,071
They're especially effective
against Draymon-type

94
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:48,610
Digimon, hence the
phrase Draymon Destroyer.

95
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,850
With these devices, we might be able to
defeat the Dark Masters.

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,010
Izzy, you're a genius!

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,530
Draymon Destroyer, huh?

98
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,170
Agumon, you're gonna eat those Draymon
alive!

99
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,730
That's not what I had in mind.

100
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,970
Hey, Vicious!

101
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,350
Learned anything new in school?

102
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,450
We learned Divermon are in the area.

103
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,510
Hey, guys!

104
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,690
We got trouble!

105
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,070
I caught a whopper.

106
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,350
Look!

107
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
Wait, what are Divermon?

108
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh, those are Meadowseedramon's henchmen.

109
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,400
It seems the fish have seen them about 200
miles behind us.

110
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Huh?

111
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,700
What are we gonna do?

112
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,400
Well, we can't stay here.

113
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,640
They'll find us too easily.

114
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm gonna dive.

115
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,100
Quick!

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,360
Everyone get inside me!

117
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,420
And don't mind the smell.

118
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,320
I had fish for lunch.

119
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Ew!

120
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,200
Red Leader to Blue Leader.

121
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
Areas 13 through 18 are clear!

122
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,260
Gold Leader to Blue Leader.

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,380
Areas 23 and 24 are clear, too!

124
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,180
Listen, Bill, Sid, how many times do I
have to tell you guys?

125
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,340
There are just three of us!

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,600
You can call me Jim!

127
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,220
What are you guys?

128
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,200
Knock it off!

129
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:17,660
Sorry!

130
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,100
Do you smell something?

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,320
There's a set of digi-destined in the
current.

132
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,640
Either that, or there's a bad patch of
seaweed around here.

133
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,820
Ew!

134
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,460
This is my moment to shine!

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,840
Does my hair look alright?

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah!

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,020
You digi-destined fools!

138
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,540
You can swim, but you can't hide!

139
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,860
I was

140
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,880
taking catnapping and it woke me up.

141
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,160
I'll explain later.

142
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,660
Oh, come on!

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
You think I'm too brainless to understand?

144
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,140
Yes, but I'll tell you anyway.

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Check it out!

146
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,220
What is it?

147
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
What did you do, Izzy?

148
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,420
What a cool screensaver.

149
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,960
It's not a screensaver.

150
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
What is it then?

151
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,760
I connected to Waymon's
hard drive and rerouted

152
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,940
all his sensory
information to my computer.

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Rerouted?

154
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,660
In other words, what
you're seeing on the screen

155
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,200
is exactly what Waymon
is looking at right now.

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,760
Cool!

157
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,700
Like a submarine!

158
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:15,701
Oh boy!

159
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
I've always wanted to go in a submarine!

160
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,260
I think she's been out of the sea a little
too long.

161
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,740
Yeah, I hate square dances.

162
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
What's wrong, Kari?

163
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,340
It's my ears!

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
They're starting to hurt!

165
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,380
Nini, stop!

166
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Be quiet!

167
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh!

168
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,480
Hey, you know, my ears hurt a little too.

169
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Me too!

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,880
Sorry, I dove a little too fast.

171
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll fix the pressure now.

172
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Hold on.

173
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Oh!

174
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,260
Oh!

175
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:47,260
Oh, that's better!

176
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,960
Well, I guess that's one way to equalize
the gas pressure.

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
By the way, you're excused.

178
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,620
What's that sound?

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Huh?

180
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,520
It's getting louder!

181
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,080
Everyone, be quiet!

182
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,720
Sounds like Divermon!

183
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Huh?

184
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,500
Sounds like they passed us.

185
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,340
We're not out of danger yet.

186
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,640
You'll have to be quiet a little longer.

187
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Over there!

188
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:35,701
Hey, it's Waymon!

189
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Oh, no!

190
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
They found us!

191
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,921
Red Leader, this is...
I mean, this is Phil.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I found Waymon!

193
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,200
He's in Area 51 on the ocean floor!

194
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,000
Great!

195
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,960
Keep an eye on it!

196
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,680
I'll tell the boss, and he can tell Metal
Seedramon!

197
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Good news!

198
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,180
We found Waymon!

199
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Hey!

200
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,180
What do we do now?

201
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,540
Oh, master of the ocean!

202
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Attack!

203
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Striking face!

204
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,380
Watch out!

205
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,940
The Divermon are attacking!

206
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Hang on, everyone!

207
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,800
I've got an idea!

208
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,190
Where did all those bubbles come from?

209
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,570
Key!

210
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,170
I couldn't see where I was aiming!

211
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,570
Uh-oh!

212
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,550
You're squeezing me too hard!

213
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,690
Matt, you're squeezing me too hard!

214
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,770
Sorry, I guess we're all a little scared.

215
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,390
Ugh!

216
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,310
I hate this!

217
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,930
We're stuck in here and can't bite!

218
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,850
According to the audio sensors,
there are three more.

219
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,850
Behind us!

220
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:46,851
What is it, Waymon?

221
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,050
It's the enemy!

222
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,030
Don't let them get away!

223
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,890
Oh, they're gaining on us!

224
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,050
That's it!

225
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,350
I'm tired of running!

226
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,230
Come on, Waymon, let's go up to the
surface and fight!

227
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:00,231
Right!

228
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,650
Well... Let me try
one more thing.

229
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,250
Hopefully it'll work.

230
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,990
What do you mean, hopefully it'll work?

231
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,810
That's what the captain of the Titanic
said!

232
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,470
Striking fish!

233
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,490
And what if it doesn't work?

234
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,630
What's plan B?

235
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,090
I still think we should turn and fight.

236
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,970
I hope you know what you're doing,
Waymon.

237
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,990
What's he trying to do?

238
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,290
Waymon must be crazy trying to escape into
such a narrow space.

239
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,410
Stay with him!

240
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,610
No matter what!

241
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,870
You and the big whale!

242
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,530
Pull over!

243
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,970
It's no use!

244
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,130
We've got you tracked!

245
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,390
Oh no!

246
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,570
Don't catch us!

247
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,210
No!

248
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,540
A break!

249
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
That's gotta hurt!

250
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,900
Prodigious!

251
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,300
They can't take the water pressure!

252
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,040
That was Waymon's plan all along!

253
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,020
Waymon is built to handle pressure!

254
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,320
Unlike some of us!

255
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,500
Well, forgive me for not being a whale!

256
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,460
Boy, that was close!

257
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,740
I didn't know you had this kind of hidden
attack!

258
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,860
This is great!

259
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,540
But what are we gonna do now?

260
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,300
Yeah, we can't stay at the bottom of the
ocean forever!

261
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
I've got it!

262
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,740
Kari, come over here for a moment!

263
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
That was great!

264
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
That was good!

265
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,020
We've got it!

266
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,021
I've got it!

267
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:12,480
I've got it!

268
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:12,500
It was great!

269
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,140
It was great!

270
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:13,620
You've got it!

271
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,660
Thanks for the help!

272
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,661
Sure.

273
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,720
The whistle was sort of like sonar.

274
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,300
We used the reverberations of the sound to
find a tunnel.

275
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,600
And there's one up ahead that should lead
us to land.

276
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Cool.

277
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,000
Isn't that great, Waymon?

278
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,620
What?

279
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,220
I said, isn't that great?

280
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I can't hear you.

281
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,960
Someone was whistling in my ear.

282
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,460
But there's a tunnel up ahead.

283
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,860
It should lead us to land.

284
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Those fools think I don't know where
they're headed.

285
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,520
They're easier to figure out than a
two-piece jigsaw puzzle.

286
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,900
Enjoy playing submarine while you can.

287
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,620
Wow!

288
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Pretty!

289
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,340
Aha!

290
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,060
A tunnel?

291
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Yay!

292
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,700
Yay!

293
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
We're safe!

294
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
I've got to get changed!

295
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Huh?

296
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
Hug!

297
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Yay!

298
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Not again!

299
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,500
How can those fish heads be back?

300
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,020
They're not.

301
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Be careful, everyone!

302
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,820
It's Metal Seedramon!

303
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,280
Yaaah!

304
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,800
Yaaaah!

305
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,180
Yaaaaah!

306
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:28,520
Yaaaah!

307
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,820
Yaaaaah!

308
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,330
Is everybody okay?

309
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,070
Where… where are we?

310
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,620
The sun's so bright!

311
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,760
Smell that.

312
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,680
Fresh air.

313
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,520
I feel I've been underwater so long,
I might never take a bath again.

314
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,280
You mind telling me what's so funny?

315
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,000
It's Metal Seedramon!

316
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
How can it be?

317
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,740
It was only a matter of time before you
came up for air.

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
Now you're going down with the ship!

319
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,120
Everyone, hold on!

320
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Should I?

321
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,080
Agumon gets their attention.

322
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,040
Let's cross over to the shore and prepare
ourselves for battle.

323
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Aye, aye.

324
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,740
Uh, Goldmumon and I will stay here and
bring up the rear.

325
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,120
Joe, don't be such a coward.

326
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,280
Agumon!

327
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Here I go!

328
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,600
Agumon, more Digimon!

329
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:00,620
Ha!

330
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Digimon!

331
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
exotic araadrum.

332
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:26,220
Oh, poor promo!

333
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:42,900
Oh, Mom!

334
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,520
Ikakumon, thanks for everything,
but you can leave the rest to us.

335
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,220
What?

336
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,860
No tip?

337
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,140
Hurry and get out of here.

338
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,120
You're an easy target.

339
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
You're just too big.

340
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,680
Are you calling me fat?

341
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm just Big Bone.

342
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Striking fish!

343
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm Blue Torpedo!

344
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Ikakumon, quick!

345
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Digiball!

346
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,100
Digiball 2!

347
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,300
Is everybody okay?

348
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Round

349
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,770
of you, WarGreymon!

350
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,070
Say goodbye!

351
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,930
Is this really the end for WarGreymon?

352
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,270
Will the DigiDestined ever defeat the Dark
Masters?

353
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,470
Find out on the next Digimon Digital
Monsters.
