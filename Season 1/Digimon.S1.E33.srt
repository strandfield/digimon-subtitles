1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We figured the eighth child had to be
somewhere in the Shibara section of town.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,381
So the rest of us spread
out while Joe made phone

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,681
calls to every school kid
we knew four years ago.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,920
Maybe one of those kids is the
Digi-Destined.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,962
Meanwhile, that flea-bitten
menace Gatomon was still

6
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:16,560
on the prowl, causing
who-knows-what kind of trouble.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,780
Meany and Sora stumbled onto this
fire-breathing bozo called Skull Meromon.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,259
And things looked pretty
gnarly till MetalGreymon

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,380
joined the fight and
was able to cool him off.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,740
Well, sort of.

11
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,490
Let me drive.

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,686
You're going the wrong way.

13
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,990
How do you know which way to go?

14
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,830
You've never been to the real world
before.

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,790
What's the difference?

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,550
I've never driven a car before either.

17
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,990
Well, it's my first time too.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,350
Whoa, check him out!

19
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,590
Ew!

20
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,270
So these are city people in the real
world.

21
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,650
They don't look like much fun.

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,250
Well, Pumpkinmon, you're the right guy to
teach them what fun really is.

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,410
You are without a doubt the most rockin'
creature to ever have a pumpkin for a head.

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,730
Remember, Cheeks dig evil Digimon.

25
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,270
At least that's what I keep telling myself
anyway.

26
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,570
Gatsumon, you are the mon.

27
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,010
We're going to have such a blast here in
the real world.

28
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,770
They might even name a building after you.

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,830
The Gatsumonument, where they keep all the
party supplies.

30
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,251
Three, two, one... Yeah!

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,680
How much longer, Matt?

32
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,860
Relax, TK.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
You're almost home.

34
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,430
Matt and TK's mom and dad aren't together
anymore, Padaman.

35
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,090
So even though they're brothers,
they don't live together.

36
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:37,150
So TK lives with their mom and Matt lives
with their dad.

37
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:40,910
That explains why they try so hard to stay
together all the time.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,100
Sure late.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,680
Yeah?

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,200
So?

41
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,300
The next stop's good enough.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,860
No.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm gonna take you all the way home,
little brother.

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,540
You don't have to.

45
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,700
I know I don't have to, but I'm going to,
okay?

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,900
I've got my reasons.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
What reasons?

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,720
You're my brother.

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,580
Thanks, Matt.

50
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:07,260
Ah, nothing like sweet brotherly love.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,680
That's a digi mouthful.

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,260
We like when you guys get pushy.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Hey, quit it!

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Easy, TK.

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,840
You don't have to be mean about it.

56
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,660
I thought what you guys said was not your
own beeswax.

57
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,700
Why are you listening to our conversation
anyway?

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,460
Fine.

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,560
You don't want me around, I'll leave.

60
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
Padaman?

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,120
I know what I'm not wanting!

62
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,761
Padaman, don't... Huh?

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
Padaman got off the train, TK.

64
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,620
Don't you want to go after him?

65
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
Who cares about him?

66
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,100
I think you care about him.

67
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Don't you?

68
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,560
TK?

69
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,740
Better decide, TK.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
The door's closing.

71
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
Where'd he go?

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,680
Where are we?

73
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,450
It seems like we've been walking around
for hours.

74
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,210
Yeah, I'm tired.

75
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,330
And I don't even have any feet or legs.

76
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,490
You shouldn't have yelled at him like
that, TK.

77
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,630
Hey, it's not my fault.

78
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,190
Well, actually, it is.

79
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,430
Oh, I'm really sorry.

80
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,290
I understand, TK.

81
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,190
I know you didn't mean to hurt his
feelings.

82
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:26,410
Well, I thought he was making fun of us.

83
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,590
No way, dude.

84
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,310
You know Padaman better than that.

85
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,290
Hey, why don't we try looking over there?

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Another winner!

87
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,780
So will you give me a few?

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,520
What, again?

89
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,280
I'll pay you back, I promise!

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,080
You'll pay me back with what?

91
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,900
With what I'm about to win!

92
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,360
But you never win!

93
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm hot tonight!

94
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Hey, you two!

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,640
You kids just don't get the message!

96
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,160
Get out and stay!

97
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,340
If you have to try sneaking in here
dressed as cartoon characters,

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,160
at least get a decent costume!

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,880
Boy, it's a good thing we were just about
to leave!

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,380
We teach you some manners!

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,900
What did you just say?

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Uh-oh, oh boy!

103
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,080
And I told her, don't get the fuchsia lip
gloss whatever you do!

104
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
It's so bad!

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,560
Whoa!

106
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,100
I think you knocked over a monster!

107
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,920
Even worse, I think I knocked over a
teenager!

108
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,620
I've heard about these strange looking
creatures.

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,020
Hey, it takes one to know one!

110
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,860
Excuse me!

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,056
Do you know what time it is?

112
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,100
Time for new clothes!

113
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,820
Get lost, you creeps!

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,480
And what's with the costumes?

115
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,380
Aren't you guys a little late for
Halloween?

116
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,920
What's Halloween?

117
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't think I like these teenage things!

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,760
Me either.

119
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,640
Maybe I can reprogram her if I pull out
her safety mechanism.

120
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,020
Come back here, you little mutants!

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,520
This teenage thing is gonna teach you some
manners!

122
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Huh?

123
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Huh?

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Uh-huh!

125
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
Uh-huh!

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,260
Uh-huh!

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,500
Uh-huh!

128
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,340
Uh-huh!

129
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,341
Uh-huh!

130
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,060
Uh-huh!

131
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:16,061
Hold it right there!

132
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,880
Why are you two in such a hurry?

133
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,180
Do you know these guys?

134
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,040
I sure do!

135
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,300
They work for Myotismon!

136
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Uh-huh!

137
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,760
You're right!

138
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,320
But right now we're being chased by
something even scarier than Myotismon!

139
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,700
Huh?

140
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,580
There's a really mad teenage human after
us!

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,316
Come to think of it, you'd better hide
too!

142
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,720
Come on!

143
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,020
Ugh!

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,280
You can run, but you can't hide dressed in
those stupid costumes!

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Where are they?

146
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,260
Uh, they went that way.

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Thanks!

148
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,220
I think I know why you two troublemakers
are in the real world.

149
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,020
Did Myotismon happen to send you here to
find someone?

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,040
Yeah!

151
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,680
That 8th DigiDestined kid!

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,480
Huh!

153
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,380
Then you're our enemy!

154
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
No, we're not!

155
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,360
We just want to cruise around the city and
have some fun!

156
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
Well, we thought you two were Evil
Digimon!

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Evil shmeevil!

158
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,420
We love it here!

159
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,020
In fact, next stop, Hollywood!

160
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Ah!

161
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,300
They're not ready for TV.

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,280
Typical.

163
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,160
Everybody wants to be in show business.

164
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,660
Lights, cameras, and action!

165
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,661
Ugh!

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,680
Hey!

167
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,600
There's some light!

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,940
Yeah!

169
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,420
Whoa!

170
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,560
What are they doing up there?

171
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,560
Hey!

172
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,320
Get down!

173
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
Stop!

174
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
That's enough!

175
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,080
That's not funny!

176
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
It's me!

177
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,060
Sirens!

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,180
Get down or the police will arrest you!

179
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,040
We better get out of here, guys!

180
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Let's run!

181
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,120
Did he just say let's run?

182
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,520
Sure!

183
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,300
Wait for us!

184
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,070
Hey!

185
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,910
Where are Pumpkinmon and Gatsumon?

186
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,170
They were right behind us!

187
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,850
They must have gotten lost or something!

188
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,590
Those two!

189
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,350
Even when they're found, they're lost!

190
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,050
Oh!

191
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,570
Sweetie!

192
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,930
Ta-da!

193
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,850
Man oh man!

194
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,610
I think this one makes me look fat,
but what do you think?

195
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,790
Well then, let's switch!

196
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,870
You guys need to change your attitude!

197
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,750
You need to change your clothes!

198
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,090
Oh wow!

199
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,030
This look says you're not afraid to think
big!

200
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,750
Here's a sporty look!

201
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:22,010
Of course, I haven't figured out what
sport it is yet!

202
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,970
And finally, something nice and a little
teddy!

203
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,310
Well, what do you think?

204
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,010
Oh!

205
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,830
Hey!

206
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,690
Patamon!

207
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,030
Hey!

208
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,470
Patamon, come back!

209
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,970
So should we follow those guys?

210
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,210
And why not?

211
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,290
Do you see him anywhere, Matt?

212
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,970
No.

213
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,830
Looks like we lost him again, TK.

214
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,271
Patamon doesn't usually hold a grudge,
but he was mad as a bull with a black gear!

215
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,870
Hey now, don't look so bummed out!

216
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,630
Yeah, I'm sure you'll find your little
flying pig friend somewhere!

217
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,770
Maybe some ice cream will cheer you all
up, huh?

218
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,470
What?

219
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,370
You guys don't have any money,
so how did you get ice cream?

220
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,750
We stole it!

221
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,250
I can't believe you two!

222
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,470
Everywhere you guys go, there's trouble!

223
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,930
The next time you two get someone angry,
make sure they can't run very fast!

224
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,030
So, want some ice cream?

225
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,330
Not me.

226
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,170
You stole it!

227
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,150
Gabamon won't take it either, right?

228
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,011
Ice cream... yeah... Gabamon!

229
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,300
Gabamon!

230
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,301
My otis man!

231
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
My otis man!

232
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Losers.

233
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,880
Failures.

234
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,740
No, no.

235
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Don't say that!

236
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,600
Instead of causing pain and suffering,
I find you here, eating ice cream.

237
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,200
Well, it is stolen!

238
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,820
I don't care about ice cream!

239
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,820
Have you found the eighth Diggie Destined
child yet?

240
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,940
Well, we were about to find him.

241
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,500
Redeem yourselves by stealing the crests
from these children or else.

242
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,480
No problem, boss.

243
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,080
That's just what we were about to do.

244
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,260
Can you believe those truths turning on
us?

245
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,640
And I thought Pumpkinmon and Gatsummon
only wanted to have fun, not fight.

246
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,360
I suppose they'd rather fight us than
fight Myotismon.

247
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,920
I just can't stay mad at TK anymore.

248
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,160
Besides, I really miss him.

249
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,280
So I told Rebecca and Sarah to just find
us at the park later.

250
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,940
That'll work.

251
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,060
It's like, it's so easy to find somebody
at the park.

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,460
Yeah, it's totally easy to find somebody
there.

253
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,620
Oh, in the park.

254
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Whoa!

255
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,300
Hey, how'd you do that?

256
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Aren't I amazing?

257
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Well, you might make a nice pie.

258
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,900
Come on, let's turn around.

259
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,480
Whoa!

260
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:10,780
Huh?

261
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,280
I don't think so.

262
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,140
We're surrounded.

263
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,060
Sorry we have to do this to you guys.

264
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
But orders are orders.

265
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
You understand.

266
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,080
All right, if it's a fight you want,
let's do it.

267
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,200
Uh, I quit.

268
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Ah, me too.

269
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,540
Huh?

270
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,940
Why should we fight?

271
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,140
Somebody always gets hurt.

272
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,400
Besides, it's way more fun just hanging
out and cruising around the city.

273
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,480
That's for sure.

274
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,740
Hey, why don't you guys hang out with us?

275
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Huh?

276
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:48,960
Whoa!

277
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,200
My Otisman's coming.

278
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,320
You should all hide.

279
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Quiet.

280
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,250
Where are the Digi destined?

281
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,770
Uh, they were here just a second ago.

282
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,990
They must have got away.

283
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,250
Yeah!

284
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,350
You can't believe how fast they are,
but we almost had them, boss.

285
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:09,351
Yes.

286
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,930
I can imagine.

287
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,050
You had your chance.

288
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,050
Now I'm condemning you to my dungeon in
the Digi-World.

289
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,770
Grizzly wings!

290
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,650
Pumpkinmon power!

291
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,300
Pumpkinmon!

292
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,200
Gatsumon!

293
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
Don't watch!

294
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,720
Well, that wasn't very difficult.

295
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,520
Now it's your turn.

296
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,300
Those two, they were really trying to save
us.

297
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
You're right.

298
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Oh, and you just condemned them for no
reason at all!

299
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Digimon!

300
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,440
He should pay for what he did to those
two!

301
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,620
Crimson Lightning!

302
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:46,621
Wait a minute.

303
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Those guys just wanted to be our friends.

304
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Garuruma!

305
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,700
One!

306
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,500
Diddy ball!

307
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Two!

308
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,240
We're Garuruma!

309
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,700
Go and get him!

310
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,720
Those girls said the park was the place to
find someone, but where's TK?

311
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,500
They're up there!

312
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,190
Oh no, look out!

313
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,310
Crimson lightning!

314
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,990
We're Garuruma!

315
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,290
We're Garuruma's in big trouble,
and it's all my fault!

316
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,208
If I hadn't been so mean,
Patamon would still be with

317
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,890
us, and we would have never
met Punkimon and Gatsumon!

318
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,894
And if those poor guys
had never met up with

319
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:45,170
us, they wouldn't be
stuck where they are now!

320
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,171
Oh...

321
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,790
Digimon!

322
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:06,040
It's mine!

323
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Digimon!

324
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,350
Angemon!

325
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,390
Digimon!

326
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,550
Digimon!幹 couple monsters!

327
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,870
Digimon!

328
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,010
Ah!

329
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,380
Mon,

330
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,670
are you all right, we're Gururuman?

331
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,030
Yes, thanks to you I am.

332
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,370
Anjumon rules!

333
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,030
Well, I guess we don't have to look for
Patamon anymore.

334
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,170
Hmm, Anjumon, they must be desperate if
they sent you.

335
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,310
Anjumon, shall we take him?

336
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,570
Let's go.

337
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,130
Hey, Digimon, hey, Digimon.

338
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,590
Monster friends to the boys and girls.

339
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,310
Hey, Digimon, hey, Digimon.

340
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,610
Champions of the digital world.

341
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,560
It's time I take my lead.

342
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
We will fight again.

343
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,840
Hey, Digimon, hey, Digimon.

344
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,240
Champions of the digital world.

345
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,680
I hope they're all right.

346
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Me too.

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,520
Gabumon?

348
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:26,420
Huh?!

349
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, oh!

350
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Padamon?

351
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,980
Are you okay?

352
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Yes.

353
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,880
I'm all right now, TK.

354
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm sorry, Padamon.

355
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,820
I'm sorry I got mad.

356
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,300
Don't cry, TK.

357
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
It's all right.

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,660
Hey, look at that window!

359
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
That's were those crazy Digimon tried on
all the clothes, remember?

360
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,500
Look out!

361
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
We're going Hollywood!

362
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
Ta-da!

363
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
Come on, have some ice cream, guys.

364
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,580
Yeah, it was a steal!

365
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,200
They were funny.

366
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,000
I know what you mean, TK.

367
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
I miss them, too.

368
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,740
I guess we shouldn't take our friends for
granted.

369
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,278
TK nearly lost Panamon's
friendship, and who knows

370
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,561
if we'll ever see Pumpkinmon
and Gatsumon again.

371
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,900
But one thing's for sure.

372
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,300
I know Myotismon isn't through with us
yet.

373
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,920
His henchmen are out there right now,
searching for the Eighth Digi-Destined.

374
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,361
You may be sweet, little Kari, but
next time I will get my claws into you.

375
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,137
Will Kari survive her
next encounter with

376
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,820
Gatoman, Iotismon,
Iotismon's most loyal servant?

377
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,180
Find out on the next Digimon Digital
Monsters.

378
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,480
That's okay with Edmonds.

379
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,481
That thing falls...
